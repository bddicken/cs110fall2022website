### Course Format and Teaching Methods

The course will have three required meeting times per-week.
The in-class experience will consist of a combination of lecture, programming demonstrations, and in-class activities.
This course will use active learning, peer-teaching, and flipped-classroom teaching techniques.

By **active learning**, I mean that class time won't be just 50 minutes of me talking.
Instead, class meetings will include a number of in-class activities (ICAs) for you to work on individually and/or in a group.
Thus, you can spend some time "actively" learn, rather than "passively" listen to the instructor.

By **peer-teaching**, I mean that you will have opportunities to learn from your classmates, and vice-versa.
In many of the in-class activities, you will be able to work on groups and help each-other when necessary.

By **flipped-classroom**, I mean that you will often be assigned reading or other material to complete _before_ attending each class meeting time.
By doing this, you will come to class with (at least some) preparation.
This will hopefully result in more class time allocated towards active learning!

### Course Objectives 

By the end of the semester, you should be able to write complete, well-structured programs in python.

### Learning Outcomes

This successful CSc 110 student will be able to:

* When provided a specification, students will be able to use variables, control structures, basic data types, lists, dictionaries, file I/O, and functions to write correct 100 - 200 line programs.
* Given a programming task, students will be able to decompose a problem into an appropriate set of functions, loops, conditionals, and/or other control flow.
* Provided with a list of assertions about code that contains loops and conditionals, students will be able to state whether these are true, false or sometimes true.
* Given a program that isn't working properly, students will be able to find bugs using print statements and computational thinking skills, and will be able to understand and resolve errors.
* Students will be able to follow a provided style guide to write clean, well-structured, and readable code.
* Students should be able to explain the conceptual memory model underlying the data types covered in class, and demonstrate the ability to convert integers and text to and from binary.

_(These learning outcomes are derived from ones developed by Allison Obourn and other faculty at the UA)._

### Coursework and Grading Policies

The breakdown of grades in this course is as follows:

* 60% exams
* 25% programming assignments (PAs)
* 10% attendance
* 5% prep problems

For every day of live class (MWF), there will typically be three things to complete beforehand, or on the same day as the class:

* The required reading from the book (you can find what you are supposed to read on the course schedule)
* A prep problem (a short programming activity, can also find on course schedule)
* Attend class

You can find the readings/prep problems that are required for each class day.
You should complete the readings either before the corresponding class day, or on that day.
These readings can help reinforce the concepts you are learning in the class.

Generally, the prep problems will be based on recently covered or new topics in the class.
In total these will contribute to 5% of the student grade.
The general flow for any given class day (MWF) should be like so:

Attendance at class with be worth 10% or your grade.
During class, there may be attendance questions at various times throughout class.
Answering these attendance questions correctly contributes towards this 10%.

There will be a number of programming assignments throughout the class, which will contribute to 25% percent of the student's grade.
These assignments should be treated as individual-work projects, unless otherwise specified by the instructor.

There will be four exams throughout the course (including the final), for a total of 60%.
These exams may cover material from class, the programming assignments, the final project, and the readings.

Each exam will be worth 15% of your grade.
The first three exams will have two components each: a group component and an individual component.
The group component with be worth 4% of the exam and the individual component will be worth 11% of the exam.
Your lowest individual exam grade will be dropped.
Thus, each of the two non-dropped individual exams will end up being worth 33% of the grade.
If you arrive at class more than 10 minutes late for a group exam, the instructor reserves the right to not let you participate, deduct your grade, or give you a zero.
If you would like an exam regraded, we reserve the right to regrade the entire exam, not only the parts you might question.

The final exam is worth 15%, and does not have a group component.

The instructor and teaching staff will do their best to have grades back to students within 1 week.
This includes, but is not limited to, grades for exams, projects, programming assignments, attendance, and quizzes.
Once a grade has been entered for a particular item on the digital grade-book, students have at most 5 days to dispute the grade.
This includes disputes related to excuses such as sickness, personal matters, dean's excuses, etc.
If 5 days pass and there has not been such a request, the grade is final.

The correspondence between percentage grade and numeric grade is as follows:

* Greater than 90% at least an A
* Greater than 80% at least a B
* Greater than 70% at least a C
* Greater than 60% at least a D
* Anything less, at least an E / F

### Groups

There will be approximately 3-4 weeks of class between each of the exams.
During each of these time spans, I will break the class up into groups of 3-4 students.
Thus, in total, you will be in 4 different student groups throughout the course.
I highly encourage that you get-to-know all of your fellow students in each of your groups.
Not only is it a good way to meet new people, but there are several additional motivations:

* Each group will sit at a table together, and will be able to collaborate on in-class activities.
* The first three exams will have a group component.
  This group component will be taken in the same group that you were in leading up-to the exam.

### Late Days

In this class, you are given 3 late days for programming assignments.
What this means is that you are allowed to submit up to three programming assignments within 24 hours after the due date throughout the semester, without penalty.
you may not use these for short PAs, these are for Regular PAs.
You should not burn through all of these free late days on the first three assignments though!
Consider saving some for later in the course, when you might be in dire need :).

### Final Exam

The final exam will be on:

* For the 1pm course: Monday, December 12th 1-3pm
* For the 2pm course: Friday, December 9th 1-3pm

You keep this time available.
Do not schedule any flights, travel plans, or other conflicts with these exams.

### Textbook

There is one required textbook for this course: 
**Starting out with Python (4th).**
The ISBN-13 number is **978-0134444321**.

This book is rather pricey on Amazon (around $100).
See for yourself: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134444329/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134444329/)

However, there is good news.
Via the inclusive access program at the UofA, you can get a digital copy of this textbook for less-than $30.
This should automatically be charged to your bursars account, and you should have access to the text through D2L from day-1 of the course.
If you would rather have a hard-copy, there is an option to upgrade (for a fee) so that you can have the digital book and a loose-leaf copy.
You can also just purchase on Amazon.

Please access the material through D2L the first day of classes to make sure there are no issues in the delivery, and if you are having a problem or question, it can be addressed quickly.
You must take action (even if you have not accessed the materials) to opt-out if you do not wish to pay for the materials, and choose to source the content independently.
If you would like to opt-out, contact the uofa bookstore as soon as you can so that you do not miss the deadline.
Preferably, within the first week of class.
If you do not opt-out and choose to retain your access, the cost of the digital course materials will appear on your October Bursars account.
