Something is coming. Something hungry for blood.
A shadow grows on the wall behind you, swallowing you in darkness.
It is almost here. What is it?
What if it's the Demogorgon?
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
It's not the Demogorgon.
An army of troglodytes charge into the chamber!
Troglodytes? Told ya.
Wait a minute.
Did you hear that?
That... that sound?
Boom... boom...
Boom!
That didn't come from the troglodytes. No, that...
That came from something else.
The Demogorgon!
We're in deep shit. Will, your action!
I don't know! Fireball him!
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!
Too risky. Cast a protection spell.
Don't be a pussy. Fireball him! Cast Protection.
The Demogorgon is tired of your silly human bickering!
It stomps towards you.
Boom! Fireball him!
Another stomp, boom! Cast Protection.
He roars in anger!
Fireball!
Oh, shit! Where'd it go?
Where is it? I don't know!
Is it a 13? I don't know!
Where is it? Oh, my God!
Mike! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Mike! Can you find it yet?
No, I can't find it!
Mike! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!
You mean the end? Fifteen after.
Oh, my God! Freaking idiot! Why do we have to go?
Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes! It's a school night, Michael.
I just put Holly to bed. You can finish next weekend.
But that'll ruin the flow! Michael
I'm serious, Mom.
The campaign took two weeks to plan.
How was I supposed to know it was gonna take ten hours?
You've been playing for ten hours?
Dad, don't you think that 20 more I think you should listen to your mother.
Dang dumb piece of junk.
Oh, I got it!
Does the seven count? It was a seven?
Did Mike see it? Then it doesn't count.
Yo, hey, guys.
Does anyone want this? No.
Yeah.
No, I don't think...
Yeah, he's cute.
Barb, no, I don't think so.
Barb, you're not Hey, Nancy.
There's a slice left if you want it.
Sausage and pepperoni! Hold on.
There's something wrong with your sister. What are you talking about?
She's got a stick up her butt. Yeah.
It's because she's been dating that douchebag, Steve Harrington.
Yeah, she's turning into a real jerk.
She's always been a real jerk.
Nuhuh, she used to be cool.
Like that time she dressed up as an elf for our Elder tree campaign.
Four years ago!
Just saying. Later.
It was a seven. Huh?
The roll, it was a seven.
The Demogorgon, it got me.
See you tomorrow.
Good night, ladies. Kiss your mom 'night for me.
Race you back to my place? Winner gets a comic.
Any comic? Yeah.
Hey! Hey!
"I didn't say ""go""!"
Get back here!
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll take your XMen 134!
Son of a bitch.
Mom?
Jonathan? Mom?
Hello? Hello?
And that's it for News Center this morning.
Thanks for joining us.
Let's hand off now to Liz at the news desk.
All right, thank you, Donna.
Turning now to local news,
we're getting reports of surges and power outages all across the county.
Last night, hundreds of homes in East Hawkins were affected,
leaving many residents in the dark.
The cause of the outage is still unknown.
We reached out to Roane County Water and Electric,
and a spokesperson says that they are confident
power will be restored to all remaining homes
within the next several hours.
Mmm.
In other news, you might wanna stay home tonight
or at least pack an umbrella.
We turn to everybody's favorite morning weather guy, Charles.
Where the hell are they?
Jonathan? Check the couch!
Ugh, I did.
Oh... Got them.
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.
Yeah, see you later. Where's Will?
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.
He's probably still sleeping.
Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up! Mom, I'm making breakfast.
I told you this a thousand times.
Will! Come on, honey. It's time to get up.
He came home last night, right? He's not in his room?
Did he come home or not? I don't know.
You don't know? No.
I got home late. I was working.
You were working?
Eric asked if I could cover. I said yeah.
I just thought we could use the extra cash.
Jonathan, we've talked about this. I know, I know.
You can't take shifts when I'm working.
Mom, it's not a big deal. Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.
I'm sure he just stayed over. I can't believe you.
I can't believe you sometimes.
That's disgusting.
You're disgusting! Hello?
Hi, Karen. It's Joyce.
Oh, Joyce, hi. What the hell, Mike?
Hey! Quiet!
Language. Are you kidding?
Was that Will I heard back there?
Will? No, no, no, it's just Mike.
Will didn't spend the night?
No, he left here a little bit after 8:00.
Why? He's not home?
Um, you know what? I think he just left early for... for school.
Thank you so much. Bye. Okay. Bye.
That's weird. I don't see him.
I'm telling you, his mom's right.
He probably just went to class early again.
Yeah, he's always paranoid Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
Step right up and get your tickets for the freak show.
Who do you think would make more money in a freak show?
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?
I'd go with Toothless.
I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in.
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.
"""I told you a million times."""
Do the arm thing.
Do it, freak!
God, it gets me every time.
Assholes. I think it's kinda cool.
It's like you have superpowers or something.
Like Mr. Fantastic.
Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.
So, did he call?
Keep your voice down.
Did he?
I told you, it's not like that.
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me, but not like that.
We just...
made out a couple times.
"""We just... made out a couple times."""
Nance, seriously,
you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous.
No, I'm not.
You better still hang out with me, that's all I'm saying.
If you become friends with Tommy H. or Carol
Oh, that's gross!
Okay, I'm telling you, it was a onetime...
Twotime thing.
You were saying?
Steve... Mmmhmm?
I have to go. In a minute.
Steve. I really, like...
Seriously, I have to go.
Wait, wait, wait. Let's...
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?
Uh... No, I can't. I have to study for Kaminsky's test.
Oh, come on. What's your GPA again? 3.999...
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.
Well, then, just let me help. You failed chem.
Cminus. Well, in that case...
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?
Are you crazy? My mom would not I'll climb through your window.
She won't even know I'm there. I'm stealthy, like a ninja.
You are crazy.
Wait, wait, wait. Just... Okay, forget about that.
We can just...
We can just, like, chill in my car.
We can find a nice quiet place to park, and...
Steve... I have to study.
I'm not kidding.
Well, why do you think I want it to be nice and quiet?
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.
To study.
Good of you to show.
Oh, hey, morning, Flo. Morning, everybody.
Hey, Chief. Damn! You look like hell, Chief.
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
Well, I looked better than your wife when I left her this morning.
While you were drinking or sleeping,
or whatever it is you deemed so necessary on Monday morning,
Phil Larson called.
Said some kids are stealing the gnomes out of his garden again.
Oh, those garden gnomes again.
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna get right on that.
On a more pressing matter,
Joyce Byers can't find her son this morning.
Mmm. Okay, I'm gonna get on that.
Just give me a minute. Joyce is very upset.
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.
Chief, she's already in your Coffee and contemplation, Flo!
I have been waiting here over an hour, Hopper.
And I apologize again.
I'm going out of my mind!
Look, boy his age, he's probably just playing hookie, okay?
No, not my Will. He's not like that.
He wouldn't do that. Well, you never know.
I mean, my mom thought I was on the debate team,
when really I was just screwing Chrissy Carpenter
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...
Look, he's not like you, Hopper. He's not like me.
He's not like... most.
He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean.
They make fun of him. They call him names.
They laugh at him, his clothes His clothes?
What's wrong with his clothes? I don't know.
Does that matter? Maybe.
Look, he's... He's a sensitive kid.
Lonnie... Lonnie used to say he was queer.
Called him a fag.
Is he? He's missing is what he is.
When was the last time you heard from Lonnie?
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis. That was about a year ago.
But he has nothing to do with this. Why don't you give me his number?
You know, Hopper, he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times, kid goes missing,
the kid is with a parent or relative.
What about the other time?
"What? You said, ""99 out of 100."""
What about the other time, the one? Joyce.
The one!
Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?
You wanna know the worst thing that's ever happened here
in the four years I've been working here?
Do you wanna know the worst thing?
It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head
because it thought that her hair was a nest.
Okay, fine. I will call Lonnie.
He will talk to me before he talks to
What, a pig? A cop!
Just find my son, Hop.
Find him!
Dr. Brenner.
This way, gentlemen.
The entire east wing will be evacuated within the hour.
We've sealed off this area following quarantine protocol.
This is where it came from? Yes.
And the girl?
She can't have gone far.
All right, and one more.
Hey, Ben. What do you think about that, uh...
Hey, I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know, 37 points per game average
Thirtyseven now, but... Mr. Basket.
Hey!
Come here!
Hey, come here!
You think you can steal from me, boy?
What in the hell?
Remember, finish chapter 12
and answer 12.3 on the difference between an experiment
and other forms of science investigation.
This will be on the test, which will cover chapters 10 through 12.
It will be multiple choice with an essay section.
So, did it come?
Sorry, boys.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but...
it came.
Yes!
The Heathkit ham shack.
Whoa. Ain't she a beaut?
I bet you can talk to New York on this thing.
Think bigger.
California? Bigger.
Australia?
Oh, man!
When Will sees this, he's totally gonna blow his shit.
Lucas!
Sorry.
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.
What are you doing?
Hello, this is Dustin,
and this is the secretary and treasurer of Hawkins Middle AV Club.
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow Michael, Lucas and Dustin?
Okay, okay, okay.
One at a time, all right? You.
You said he takes what? Mirkwood.
Mirkwood? Yeah.
Have you ever heard of Mirkwood? I have not. That sounds made up to me.
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.
Well, The Hobbit. It doesn't matter.
"He asked! ""He asked!"""
Shut up, guys! Hey, hey, hey!
What'd I just say? Shut up.
One at a damn time. You.
Mirkwood, it's a real road. It's just the name that's made up.
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.
Yeah, all right, I think I know that We can show you, if you want.
I said that I know it!
We can help look. Yeah.
No.
No. After school, you are all to go home.
Immediately.
That means no biking around looking for your friend, no investigating,
no nonsense.
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.
The Hobbit. Shut up!
Hey! Stop it!
Do I make myself clear?
Do I make myself... clear?
Yes, sir. Yeah.
Ringadingding!
Anybody home?
Password?
Uh, Rada...
Radaga Radagast?
Yeah. You may enter.
Thank you, sir.
So, guess what?
I got off early and...
Tada! Poltergeist.
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.
I changed my mind.
As long as you don't have nightmares for a week.
No, I won't. I don't get scared like that anymore.
Oh, yeah?
Not even of clowns?
No.
What about my witch?
No. Mom... Ooh...
I'm not five anymore. But Will Byers...
I'm going to cook you up in my Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!
Will?
Will? Will?
Will?
Will? Will!
Will! Will?
Will!
Where are you?
Geez.
Your parents forget to feed you?
Is that why you ran away?
They, uh...
They hurt you?
You went to the hospital, you got scared,
you ran off, you wound up here, is that it?
All right.
I'll give this back, all right? And you can have as much as you want.
All right? Maybe even some ice cream.
But you gotta answer a few of my questions first, all right?
We got a deal?
All right, let's start with the easy stuff. All right?
My name's Benny. Benny Hammond.
See? Like this. Here.
I got you. Don't worry. It's okay.
Nice to meet you, yeah. And you are?
Eleven?
What's that mean?
What's it mean?
No. Well, I'll be damned.
She speaks.
"""No""? No, what?"
All right. I guess no more food, then.
Eleven.
Yeah.
What's it mean?
Eleven.
All right, then.
Here you go.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Yeah, look, all I know is that she's scared to death.
Yeah, I think maybe she's been abused or...
kidnapped or something.
Yeah, it'd be great if someone would come by.
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane. Yeah, Randolph.
Will Byers?
Will!
Will Byers?
Come on, kid!
Will?
Hey! I got something.
That his bike? Yeah, he must have crashed.
You think he got hurt in the fall?
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.
Bike like this is like a Cadillac to these kids.
He would've walked it home.
...get off work if I win.
Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...
...but we will cover whatever the damages are to your property.
It's just, um... That's for sure.
Is Lonnie there?
Lonnie isn't here right now. Can you please
I told you, Lonnie's not here. Who is this?
His girlfriend, Cynthia. Cynthia.
Who the hell is this? Cynthia, this is Joyce.
Who? Lonnie's exwife.
I really need to speak to him Lonnie's not here.
Can you please put No! Why don't you call back later?
No, not later. Now!
Can
Bitch! Mom.
What? You have to stay calm.
Hey, you've reached Lonnie.
Leave a message and I'll holler right back at ya.
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.
Will is... is missing. I don't know where he is.
I need...
I just need you to call me back, please, just
Damn it! Damn it!
Mom?
What?
Cops.
It was just lying there? Yeah. Cal?
Did it have any blood on it, or No, no, no, no, no...
Phil?
If you found the bike out there, why are you here?
Well, he had a key to the house, right? Yeah.
So...
maybe he came home.
You think I didn't check my own house?
I'm not saying that.
Has this always been here? What? I don't know.
Probably. I mean, I have two boys. Look at this place.
You're not sure?
Hey.
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?
Nothing, he's probably just hungry. Come on.
Hey! Jesus!
What are you, deaf? I've been calling you.
What's going on?
Hello?
Are you sure you're okay, Chief? Listen, I want you to call Flo.
I want to get a search party together, all right?
All the volunteers she can muster. Bring flashlights, too.
Hey, you think we got a problem here?
We should be out there right now. We should be helping look for him.
We've been over this, Mike. The chief says
I don't care what the chief said. Michael!
We have to do something. Will can be in danger.
More reason to stay put.
Mom! End of discussion.
So... me and Barbara are gonna study at her house tonight.
That's cool, right? No, not cool.
What? Why not?
Why do you think? Am I speaking Chinese in this house?
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.
This is such bullshit. Language.
So we're under house arrest?
Just because Mike's friend got lost on the way home from...
Wait, this is Will's fault? Nancy, take that back.
No! You're just pissed off
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.
Steve? Who is Steve?
Her new boyfriend. You are such a douchebag, Mike!
Language!
Nancy, come back.
Come back!
It's okay. It's okay, Holly. Here, have some juice, okay?
You see, Michael?
You see what happens? What happens when what?
I'm the only one acting normal here! I'm the only one that cares about Will!
That is really unfair, son.
We care.
Mike! Let him go.
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.
What did I do?
Hey! What'd I do?
Will! Will Byers!
Will!
Will, we're here for you, bud!
He's a good student.
What? Will. He's a good student.
Great one, actually.
I don't think we've met. Scott Clarke.
Teacher, Hawkins Middle. Earth and biology.
I always had a distaste for science.
Well, maybe you had a bad teacher.
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff was a piece of work.
Ratliff? You bet.
She's still kicking around, believe it or not.
Oh, I believe it. Mummies never die, so they tell me.
Sarah, my daughter...
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot... She always understood all that stuff.
I always figured there was enough going on down here,
I never needed to look elsewhere.
Your daughter, what grade is she?
Maybe I'll get her in my class. No, she, uh...
She lives with her mom in the city.
Thanks for coming out, Teach. We really appreciate it.
She died a few years back. Sorry?
His kid.
Lucas, do you copy? It's Mike.
Lucas? Hey, it's Lucas.
I know it's you.
"And say ""over"" when you're done talking so I know when you're done. Over."
I'm done. Over.
I'm worried about Will. Over.
Yeah.
This is crazy. Over.
I was thinking...
Will could've cast Protection last night, but he didn't.
He cast Fireball.
Over. What's your point? Over.
My point is... he could've played it safe, but he didn't.
He put himself in danger to help the party.
Over.
Meet me in ten. Over and out.
What are you doing here?
I told you on the phone, I'm under house arrest now.
I figured we'd just study here. No. No way.
Oh, come on. I can't have you failing this test.
So just... bear with me.
What'd I tell you?
Ninja.
You like that ice cream, huh?
Smile looks good on you.
You know, smile?
All right. You just sit tight.
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away real quick, all right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Hey, can I help you? Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid we're closed for the evening, too.
So try back tomorrow morning. Connie Frazier. Social Services.
Ah, Social Services. My apologies. I didn't expect you so soon.
That's a heck of a drive. Not too bad this time of night.
Hey, listen, I... I haven't told her that you're coming yet.
I didn't want her running off again. She's a tad skittish.
Children I work with usually are. Right, right.
So, where is she? Right. She's in the kitchen.
Come on up. I'll introduce you. Thank you.
Sorry again for trying to turn you away there.
It's fine. You know, it's funny.
Your, uh, voice sounds different on the
Ah, man. This is it.
Hey, guys. You feel that?
I think maybe we should go back. No.
We're not going back. Just stay close.
Come on.
Just stay on channel six. Don't do anything stupid.
Hey, guys, wait up.
Wait up!
"""Which polymers occur naturally?"""
Starch and cellulose.
Mmm.
"""In a molecule of CH4, the hydrogen atoms are spatially oriented"
"towards the centers of"" Tetrahedrons."
Wow. Jesus, how many of these did you make?
You said you wanted to help.
How about this? How about...
How about every time that you get something right,
I have to take off an item of clothing.
But every time that you get something wrong
Uh, pass. Oh, come on.
Come on. No.
Come on. It'll be fun. No.
"""During fractional distillation,"
"hydrocarbons are separated according to their"""
Melting point.
Ooh, it's boiling points.
That's what I meant.
Yeah, that's not what you said.
No. No?
Oh, do you need... Do you need help, or...
No.
Steve. Steve, come on.
What?
Are you crazy? My parents are here.
That's weird, I... don't see them.
Was this your plan all along? To... to get in my room and then...
get another notch on your belt. No. Nancy, no.
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.
You mean, you're not a slut.
That's not what I'm saying.
You know, you're so cute when you lie.
Shut up.
Bad Steve.
Bad. Don't do that to Miss Nancy...
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.
"""Compared to the rate of inorganic reactions,"
"the rate of organic reactions is generally..."""
Jonathan, wow. You took these?
These are great.
Wow, they really are.
I know I haven't been there for you. I've been...
working so hard and I...
I just feel bad. I don't even...
barely know what's going on with you.
All right? I am sorry about that.
Hey, what is it?
What is it, honey?
Nothing. Tell me. Tell me.
Come on. You can... No.
It's just...
I should've been there for him.
No. Oh, no. You can't do that to yourself.
This was not your fault. Do you hear me?
He is... close. I know it. I...
I feel it in my heart.
You just have to... You have to trust me on this, okay?
Yeah. Oh, look at this.
Look at this one. Look at this one.
I mean, that's it, right? Yeah.
That's it. That's the one.
Hello?
Hello?
Lonnie?
Dad? Hopper?
Who is this?
Will?
Will? It's Will?
Mom, it's Will?
Who is this?
What have you done to my boy? What? What?
Give me back my son!
Hello?
Hello, who is this?
Hello? Who is this?
Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?
It was him. Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?
Yes. What did he say?
He just breathed. He just breathed.
And was someone else there? I...
Mom, who was there? Who was it? It was him.
I know it was his breathing. I know it was his breathing.
Will!
Will! Byers!
I've got your XMen 134!
Guys, I really think we should turn back.
Seriously, Dustin?
You wanna be a baby, then go home already!
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!
No, you're just being a big sissy!
Did you ever think Will went missing because he ran into something bad?
And we're going to the exact same spot where he was last seen?
And we have no weapons or anything? Dustin, shut up.
I'm just saying, does that seem smart to you?
Shut up. Shut up.
Did you guys hear that?
Is there a number we can call for your parents?
Where's your hair? Do you have cancer?
Did you run away?
Are you in some kind of trouble? Is that blood?
Stop it! You're freaking her out! She's freaking me out!
I bet she's deaf.
Not deaf.
All right, that's enough, all right? She's just scared and cold.
Here, these are clean. Okay?
No, no, no!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
See over there? That's the bathroom.
Privacy. Get it?
You don't want it closed?
No.
Oh, so you can speak.
Okay, well...
Um, how about we just keep the door...
just like this.
Is that better? Yes.
This is mental. At least she can talk.
"She said ""no"" and ""yes."" Your threeyearold sister says more."
She tried to get naked.
There's something seriously wrong with her.
Like, wrong in the head. She just went like...
I bet she escaped from Pennhurst.
From where? The nuthouse in Kerley County.
You got a lot of family there? Bite me.
Seriously though, think about it.
That would explain her shaved hair and why she's so crazy.
Why she went like...
She's an escapee is the point. She's probably a psycho.
Like Michael Myers. Exactly!
We should've never brought her here.
So you just wanted to leave her out in that storm?
Yes! We went out to find Will, not another problem.
I think we should tell your mom. I second that.
Who's crazy now? How is that crazy?
'Cause, we weren't supposed to be out tonight, remember?
So? So if I tell my mom
and she tells your mom and your mom...
Oh, man. Our houses become Alcatraz.
Exactly. We'll never find Will.
All right, here's the plan. She sleeps here tonight.
You're letting a girl Just listen!
In the morning, she sneaks around my house,
goes to the front door and rings my doorbell.
My mom will answer and know exactly what to do.
She'll send her back to Pennhurst or wherever she comes from.
We'll be totally in the clear.
And tomorrow night, we go back out.
And this time, we find Will.
Here you go. This is my sleeping bag.
You really think she's psycho?
Wouldn't want her in my house.
Mental.
Hey, um, I never asked your name.
Is that real?
Sorry, I've just... never seen a kid with a tattoo before.
What's it mean? Eleven?
That's your name?
Eleven. Okay.
Um, well, my name's Mike. Short for Michael.
"Maybe we can call you ""El."" Short for Eleven."
Um, well, okay.
'Night, El.
'Night, Mike.
All right, Mom. Breakfast is ready.
What? No, be careful of the poster. Yeah, okay. All right.
I can't eat. I just need you to eat, Mom.
Listen. Listen, the Xerox place opens in, like, 30 minutes.
Yeah. And I don't want you to go alone...
No, I know. I told you, I got it.
...so I'm gonna have Karen take you, 'cause I should be here.
Okay. We need to make, what, 200, 300 copies?
How much is a copy? Yeah, okay.
Okay, Mom. Mom. Ten cents?
If we... Ten cents Mom. Mom. Mom!
You can't get like this, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, it's okay.
We've been waiting six hours.
I know. I came as soon as I could.
Six hours.
A little bit of trust here, all right?
We've been searching all night. Went all the way to Cartersville.
And? Nothing.
God.
Flo says you got a phone call?
Oh, yeah.
Storm barbecued this pretty good.
The storm? What else?
You're saying that that's not weird?
No, it's weird.
Can we, like, trace who made the call? Contact the
No, it doesn't work like that.
Now, uh, you're sure it was Will?
Because Flo said you just heard some breathing.
No. It was him. It was Will.
And he was scared. And then something
It was probably just a prank call. It was somebody trying to scare you.
Who would do that? Well, this thing's been on TV.
It brings out all the crazies, you know. False leads, prank calls, uh...
No, Hopper, it was not a prank. It was him.
Joyce. Come on, how about a little trust here?
What, you think I'm... I'm making this up?
I'm not saying that you're making it up.
All I'm saying is it's an emotional time for you.
And you think I don't know my own son's breathing?
Wouldn't you know your own daughter's?
You hear from, uh, Lonnie yet? No.
It's been long enough. I'm having him checked out.
Oh, come on!
You're wasting your time.
Hey, Hopper.
Hopper.
Let me go.
I'm sorry? To Lonnie's.
You know, if Will's there, it means he ran away.
And if he sees the cops, he'll think he's in trouble.
He'll... He'll hide.
You know, he's good at hiding. Yeah?
Well, cops are good at finding. Okay?
Stay here with your mom.
She needs you.
Slow down, Mike. That's disgusting.
Do a lot of studying last night?
Yeah, actually, I did.
What was your test on again? Human anatomy?
Hey, what's going on?
Nothing.
Hey, you found my supercomm.
Pretty cool, huh?
I talk to my friends with it.
Mostly Lucas, 'cause he lives so close.
Signal's pretty weak.
Got you breakfast.
So listen, this is gonna sound a little weird,
but I just need you to go out there.
Then go to the front door and ring the doorbell.
My mom will answer and you'll tell her that you're lost and that you need help.
But whatever you do, you can't tell her about last night or that you know me.
Understand?
Really, it's no big deal.
We'll just pretend to meet each other again.
And my mom, she'll know who to call.
No.
No?
No.
No... you don't want my mom to get help?
You're in trouble, aren't you?
Who...
Who are you in trouble with?
Bad.
Bad?
Bad people?
They want to hurt you?
The bad people?
Understand?
Michael, where are you? We're going to be late.
Let's go! All right, I'll be back.
Just stay here, okay? Stay here.
When was this?
Last night. Less than two miles away.
And the boy? Still missing.
It was my son. I know it.
And I... I heard something else.
Something else?
It was like, uh, some kind of animal.
I don't know. Just please tell Hop to hurry.
Will! Will Byers!
Will Byers!
Will! Will!
Hey! Anything?
You?
No, nothing but a dead phone.
Joyce?
About one step from falling off the edge.
She's been a few steps for a while now, hasn't she?
Kid's missing, man.
Show a little class.
All right. Come on, let's go!
We got a lot of ground to cover.
The chief and her, they've screwed before, huh?
Will!
"That a ""yeah"" or did they..."
Will! Will!
"""When alpha particles go through gold foil, they become..."""
"Unoccupied space. ""A molecule that can"""
Hey! I don't know,
I think you've studied enough, Nance.
Steve I'm telling you, you know, you got this.
Don't worry. Now, on to more important matters.
My dad has left town on a conference and my mom's gone with him,
'cause, you know, she doesn't trust him. Good call.
So are you in?
In for what?
No parents? Big house?
A party?
Ding, ding, ding!
It's Tuesday.
It's Tuesday! Oh, my God.
Come on.
It'll be low key. It'll just be us.
What do you say? Are you in or are you out?
Um... Oh, God. Look.
Oh, God, that's depressing.
Should we say something? I don't think he speaks.
How much you want to bet he killed him?
Shut up.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
I just...
I wanted to say, you know, um...
I'm sorry about everything.
Everyone's thinking about you.
It sucks. Yeah.
I'm sure he's fine.
He's a smart kid.
I have to go. Chemistry test.
Yeah.
Good luck. Thanks.
Attention, faculty and students.
At 8:00 p.m. tonight, there will be an assembly on the football field
in support of Will Byers and his family.
All are encouraged to attend.
Volunteer signups for search parties are still available in the office.
Oh, this is weird.
He's never this late. I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.
I thought you liked his plan.
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.
If his mom found out a girl spent the night
He's in deep shit right about now.
Hey, what if she slept naked?
Oh, my God, she didn't.
Oh, if Mrs. Wheeler tells my parents...
No way. Mike would never rat us out. I don't know.
All that matters is, after school, the freak will be back in the loony bin,
and we can focus on what really matters, finding Will.
You want anything to drink?
We have OJ, skim milk... What else?
Um, we have...
Oh, this is my living room.
It's mostly just for watching TV.
Nice, right? It's a 22inch.
That's, like, ten times bigger than Dustin's.
Pretty. I guess.
That's my sister Nancy.
And that's baby Holly.
And those are my parents.
What are your parents like?
Do they live close?
That's our LaZBoy.
It's where my dad sleeps.
You can try it if you want.
Yeah.
It's fun.
Just trust me, okay?
See? Fun, right?
Now you try.

Joyce, I wasn't expecting you today.
I brought Jeffrey in to cover. I'm not here to work.
I...
The storm last night, I...
I need a new phone.
Okay, that looks like $22.56.
Uh, yeah, you know, uh...
I gave Jonathan all my money for...
for the copies for the posters.
Uh, I need an advance.
Yes, well, of course.
Of course. Thank you.
Yeah, uh, I was thinking, two weeks?
Um...
Yes, I understand, but, you know, I have to pay Jeffrey for covering
Donald.
I've been here ten years, right?
Have I ever called in sick or missed a shift once?
I've worked, uh, Christmas Eve and Thanksgiving.
I don't know where my boy is.
He's gone.
I don't know if I'm... gonna ever see him again, if he's hurt...
I, uh...
I need this phone and two weeks' advance.
And a pack of Camels.
We're all clear. Copy that.
Extraordinary.
Ready are you? What knows you of ready?
His name's Yoda.
He can use the Force to move things with his mind, like this.
Whoosh!
Oh, this is my dinosaur, Rory.
Look, he has a speaker in his mouth so he can roar.
Oh, these are all my science fair trophies.
We got first every year.
Except for last year when we got third.
Mr. Clarke said it was totally political.
You know Will?
Did you see him? Last night? On the road?
We gotta go.
I bought pizza and macaroni.
Okay. Okay.
Ted? Is that you?
Just me, Mom!
Mike? What are you doing home? One second!
In here. I'll be right back, okay?
Please, you have to get in, or my mom, she'll find you.
Do you understand?
I won't tell her about you. I promise.
Promise?
It means something that you can't break.
Ever. Michael?
Please?
Pop!
Papa!
Papa!
No!
Papa!
No! No! No!
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Papa.
I just... I don't feel good.
I woke up and my head, it really hurt bad,
and my throat was all scratchy, and I wanted to tell you,
but the last time I told you I was sick
you made me go to school anyway, and Michael.
Yeah? I'm not mad at you.
No? No, of course not.
All this that's been going on with Will,
I can't imagine what it's been like for you.
I just...
I want you to feel like you can talk to me.
I never want you to feel like you have to hide anything from me.
I'm here for you. Okay?
Is there someone else here?
No.
Eleven?
Is everything okay?
El?
Mike. Is everything okay?
Are you sure?
Promise.
Will Byers! Will!
Whoa, whoa. Careful, careful.
I need you alive for the next few days, at least.
Oh, hell, I could survive that.
What? George Burness made the jump.
And he was drunk as a skunk. He did it on a $10 bet.
George is a liar.
You make that jump from this height, that water turns into cement.
Hits you like a ton of bricks. Break every damn bone in your body.
Nah.
Chief, you copy?
Yeah, Flo, talk to me.
Hey, Chief, we got a call from over at Benny's.
I think you need to get there right away.
Ugh, Jesus!
Suicide?
Mmmhmm.
Missing kid, suicide...
You must feel like a big city cop again, huh, Chief?
Well, I mostly dealt with strangers back then.
Benny was my friend.
Hello?
Yeah.
Can I help you? Yeah, is Lonnie around?
Yeah, he's out back. What do you want? To look around.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Hey! I'll be fast.
Hey, Will?
Will!
Will, you here? Will!
Get off!
Damn, you've gotten stronger.
Will someone please explain what the hell is going on?
Jonathan, Cynthia. Cynthia, this is Jonathan.
My oldest.
Come here. Get off me, man.
Are you out of your mind? Just listen to me.
You are out of your mind! She knows about Will.
What do you mean she knows about Will?
She pointed at him, at his picture. She knew he was missing. I could tell.
You could tell? Just think about it.
Do you really think it was a coincidence that we found her on Mirkwood,
the same place where Will disappeared?
That is weird. And she said bad people are after her.
I think maybe these bad people are the same ones that took Will.
I think she knows what happened to him. Then why doesn't she tell us?
Do you know where he is?
Do you know where Will is?
Stop it, you're scaring her! She should be scared!
If you know where he is, tell us!
This is nuts. We have to take her to your mom.
No! Eleven said telling any adult would put us in danger.
What kind of danger? Her name is Eleven?
El for short. Mike, what kind of danger?
Danger danger.
No, no, no!
We're going back to plan A. We're telling your mom.
No.
Take a look at this beaut. Should've seen it when I got it.
Took me a year, but it's almost done.
Really? You want to check up my ass, too?
I told you the same thing as I told those cops,
he's not here and he never has been.
Then why didn't you call Mom back? I don't know, I just...
I assumed she just forgot where he was.
You know, he was lost or something.
That boy never was very good at taking care of himself.
This isn't some joke, all right? There are search parties, reporters...
Hopper's not still chief, is he?
Tell your mother she's gotta get you out of that hellhole.
Come out here to the city.
People are more real here, you know?
And then I could see you more.
What, you think I don't want to see you? I know you don't.
See, that's your mother talkin' right there.
She even know you're here?
Oh, great.
So one kid goes missing, the other one runs wild?
Some real fine parenting right there.
Look, all I'm saying is, maybe I'm not the asshole, all right?
In case you forgot what he looks like.
He's kinda cute, hmm?
Maybe I'll trade you in for the younger model?
Just doesn't make any sense, Chief.
You, uh, notice anything...
odd about him the last few weeks?
No, we're fixin' to go fishing down the Etowah next Sunday.
I mean, he was lookin' forward to it. I know that.
He got any enemies you might know about?
I mean, people who might not want him around?
The exes didn't like him much. That's for sure, but...
nah.
When was the last time you saw him? Yesterday. Lunch, same as always.
Just you and the boys? Yep.
Me and Henry and...
Well, there was this, uh, this kid.
No kid did this.
Kid?
What are you talking about?
Yeah. At lunch, uh, there was this boy that, uh...
I mean, he was trying to steal food out of Benny's kitchen.
Can you imagine that?
This kid...
what'd he look like?
Well, he was about yea high. You know, tiny like.
I didn't get a good look at him, though. He was back in the kitchen.
He look like this?
Oh, no, that's... That's Lonnie's missin' kid.
No. This was a different kid.
This one had really short hair.
I mean, it was buzzed nearly down to the scalp.
Yeah, well, let's... You know, let's forget about the haircut.
I mean, if this kid had a buzz cut...
could it be Lonnie's kid?
Well, I... I didn't get a good look at him.
About the right height, though.
I mean, could've been.
Yeah, that's...
Could've been.
Because I don't want to go by myself.
Barb... Barb, it's not rocket science.
You just tell your parents you're gonna stay at my place afterwards.
No, tell them we're... studying.
Nancy! Dinner!
Coming!
Look, I gotta go. I'll see you in an hour.
Something wrong with the meatloaf?
Oh, no, I had two bologna sandwiches for lunch.
I don't know why.
Me, too.
It's delicious, Mommy. Thank you, sweetie.
So, there's this...
special assembly thing tonight...
for Will at the school field.
Barb's driving.
Why am I just hearing about this?
I thought you knew.
I told you, I don't want you out after dark until Will is found.
I know, I know, but it'd be super weird if I'm not there.
I mean, everyone's going.
Just... be back by 10:00.
Why don't you take the boys, too?
No! Mmmmmm.
Don't you think you should be there? For Will?
Sorry. Spasm.
Oh...
It's okay, Holly.
It's just a loud noise. Nice.
Will!
Better come out, buddy. Will, where are ya?
Hey, you think Earl really saw Will?
I mean, what's he doin' with a shaved head?
And stealing food from Benny?
Tell you what, when we find him, we'll ask.
Can't ask a corpse questions.
Hold up!
You got something?
Hey, what do you got? Not sure.
Maybe nothing.
I found this. In there.
No way a kid crawls through there.
I don't know...
a scared enough one might.
His brother said he was good at hiding.
El?
No adults. Just us and some meatloaf.
Don't worry. They won't tell anyone about you.
They promise. Right?
We never would've upset you if we knew you had superpowers.
Ow!
What Dustin is trying to say is that they were just scared... earlier.
That's all.
We just wanted to find our friend.
"""Friend""?"
Yeah, friend. Will?
"What is ""friend""?"
Is she serious?
Um, a friend
Is someone that you'd do anything for.
You lend them your cool stuff, like comic books and trading cards.
And they never break a promise.
Especially when there's spit. Spit?
A spit swear means... you never break your word.
It's a bond.
That's super important, because friends...
they tell each other things.
Things that parents don't know.
Barbara, pull over. What?
Pull over!
What are we doing here?
His house is three blocks away.
We can't park in the driveway.
Are you serious?
Yeah, the neighbors might see.
This is so stupid. I'm just gonna drop you off.
Calm down, Barb. Come on.
You promised that you'd go. You're coming.
We're gonna have a great time.
He just wants to get in your pants.
No, he doesn't.
Nance... seriously.
He invited you to his house.
His parents aren't home.
Come on, you are not this stupid.
Tommy H. and Carol are gonna be there.
Tommy and Carol have been having sex since, like, seventh grade.
It'll probably just be, like, a big orgy.
Gross. I'm serious!
All right, well...
you can be, like, my guardian. All right?
Make sure I don't get drunk and do anything stupid.
Ugh.
Is that a new bra?
No.
Barb, chill.
I'm chill.
Hello, ladies.
What are you doing?
It's freezing.
You ever feel cursed?
You know, the last person to go missing here was in, uh...
the summer of '23.
The last suicide was the fall of '61.
When'd the last person freeze to death?
Hey, come back inside.
Warm me up. Just...
Just give me a minute out here.
What's the weirdo doing?
El?
Will.
Superpowers.
Did you see him? On Mirkwood?
Do you know where he is?
I don't understand.
Hiding.
Will is hiding?
From the bad men?
Then from who?
Where are you?
One! Two!
Three! Stop it, Tommy, no! Don't!
You're such an asshole, Tommy.
Is that supposed to impress me?
You're not? You are a cliché, you do realize that?
You are a cliché.
What with your... your grades and your band practice.
I'm so not in band.
Okay, party girl. Why don't you just, uh, show us how it's done, then?
Okay.
You gotta make a little hole right in I got it.
Yeah, she's smart, you douche!
Chug, chug, chug.
Chug. Chug. Chug.
Barb, you wanna try?
What? No.
No, I don't want to. Thanks.
Come on. Yeah...
Come on. Yeah. Nance, I don't want to.
It's fun! Just give it a Nance...
Just... Just give it a shot.
Okay.
So you just...
Gnarly. Are you okay?
Yeah. Barb, you're bleeding.
I'm fine. Where's your bathroom?
Oh, it's... It's, uh, down past the kitchen, to the left.
Okay. Thanks.
Oh.
Oh, my, God! What the hell, Tommy?
No!
Whoo!
Hello?
Hello.
Who is this?
Will?
Will, it's me.
Talk to me.
I'm here.
Just tell me where you are, honey.
I can hear you. Please.
Mom?
Will!
Yes, it's me. It's me.
Where are you? Where are you? Just talk to me
Oh, no, no!
No!
No!
Oh, no! No, no...
No!
No!
Jonathan?
What...
"[""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" playing on stereo]"
Will...
Will...
Will, is that you?
Oh, my God.
Oh, God...
Oh, my God...
I'm freezing.
Hmm... well, I hear his mom's room has a fireplace.
Are you kidding? Oh, yeah?
Okay, well, you know, you are cleaning the sheets.
You all right? Yeah.
Yeah? Come on, let's get you some dry clothes.
Nance!
Nancy.
Where are you going?
Nowhere.
Just... upstairs.
To change.
I... fell in the pool.
Why don't you go ahead and go home.
I'll just... I'll get a ride or something.
Nance...
Barb...
I'm fine.
This isn't you.
I'm fine.
Just... go ahead and go home, okay?
Thanks.
Um...
some privacy, maybe?
Oh...
Yeah, right. Sorry.
Steve?
Damn.
Shut up.
Hello?
Nancy?
Nancy!
Hello?
Oh, my God...
Nancy!
Hey, what's the matter?
Nothing.
You're so beautiful.
Nancy!
Steve?
Hey, Steve. Mmm.
I'll...
see you tomorrow, okay?
Mmmhmm.
Oh! Jesus, you scared me.
Oh, I scared you?
I know, I should have called.
Where have you been?
We agreed on 10:00.
After the assembly, some people wanted to get something to eat.
I didn't think it'd be a big deal.
You didn't think to call and let me know?
With everything that's been going on?
I didn't realize how late it was, okay?
I'm sorry, Mom. What more do you want?
Hey, wait...
Whose sweatshirt is that?
Steve's.
Steve's.
So is Steve your boyfriend now?
What?
No!
It was just cold, so I borrowed his sweatshirt.
It's not a big deal.
Nancy?
What?
You can talk to me.
You can talk to me. Whatever happened.
Nothing happened.
Nancy.
Nothing happened.
Can I please go?
Will? Will?
Sweetheart, can you hear me?
Will...
Please...
Will...
It's me.
It's me. Just talk to me. Talk to me.
Just say...
Mom? Jonathan!
Come here. Come here. Mom, what is this?
Come here. Come here.
What's going on? It's Will. It's Will, he's...
he's trying to talk to me.
He's trying to talk to you? Yes, through... through the lights.
Mom I know.
I know.
Just... just watch.
Will... your brother's here.
Can you show him what you showed me, baby?
Please... Did you see that?
It's the electricity, Mom.
It's acting up. No.
It's the same thing that fried the phone.
No! It is not the electricity, Jonathan.
Something is going on here!
Yesterday, the wall What? What about the wall?
I don't know. I don't know. Mom, first the lights, then the wall?
I just know that Will is here.
No, Mom.
Maybe if I get more lamps No, Mom.
You don't need more lamps. You need to stop this, okay?
He is just lost.
People are looking for him, and they're going to find him.
Okay.
This isn't helping. Okay, okay.
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can you do me a favor, Mom?
Can you just try and get some sleep?
Yeah. Huh? Can you do that for me?
I promise. I will. Yeah?
Yeah. I just need to sit here for a minute.
All right, I'll go make breakfast.
Okay. Yeah?
Will?
We just tell our parents we have AV Club after school.
That'll give us at least a few hours for Operation Mirkwood.
You seriously think that the weirdo knows where Will is?
Just trust me on this, okay? Okay.
Did you get the supplies? Yeah.
Binoculars... from 'Nam.
Army knife... also from 'Nam.
Hammer, camouflage bandana...
and the wrist rocket.
You're gonna take out the Demogorgon with a slingshot?
First of all, it's a wrist rocket.
And second of all, the Demogorgon's not real.
It's made up.
But if there is something out there, I'm gonna shoot it in the eye...
and blind it. Dustin, what did you get?
Well, alrighty.
So, we've got...
Nutty Bars, Bazooka, Pez, Smarties,
Pringles, Nilla Wafers, apple,
banana, and trail mix. Seriously?
We need energy for our travels. For stamina.
And besides, why do we even need weapons anyway?
We have her. She shut one door!
With her mind!
Are you kidding me? That's insane!
Imagine all the other cool stuff she could do.
Like...
I bet... that she could make this fly!
Hey. Hey.
Okay, concentrate. Okay?
Okay, one more time.
Okay.
Use your powers, okay?
Idiot.
She's not a dog! Boys!
Time for school!
Just stay down here.
Don't make any noise, and don't leave.
If you get hungry, eat Dustin's snacks, okay?
Michael! Coming!
You know those power lines?
Power lines? Yeah.
The ones behind my house?
Yes.
Meet us there, after school.
After school?
Yeah, 3:15.
Ah.
When the numbers read threeonefive, meet us there.
"""Threeonefive."""
Threeonefive.
Hey!
Hey!
Is everything okay? Yeah!
Yeah, totally.
I just...
I feel like everyone's... staring at me.
Oh, I didn't... I didn't tell anyone.
I know.
I know. Of course not.
But what about, like, Tommy, and Carol and them?
You're being paranoid.
I'm sorry. No. No, it's cute.
Hey...
I had a good time.
Yeah.
Yeah. Me, too.
Mmm. Hmm.
Hey, Ally. Where's Barb?
Um, shouldn't you know?
You haven't seen her anywhere... at all?
There she is. Emerald City.
I heard they make space weapons in there.
Space weapons?
Yeah. You know, like, Reagan's Star Wars.
I guess we're gonna blow the Ruskies to smithereens.
Hey, can I help you?
Uh, yeah. We're here for a tour.
Oh, we don't give tours.
Okay... A quick look around.
You have to get clearance for that. You can contact, uh...
Rick Schaeffer at the Department of Energy.
Maybe you seen it on TV. We got a local kid that's missing.
We have reason to believe he might have snuck in here.
Like I said, you have to speak to Mr. Schaeffer.
What's your name? Patrick.
Patrick, I got a panicked mayor, and I got reporters breathing down my neck
and I got a very upset mother.
Now, I know the kid's not in there, but I gotta check off this box.
Patrick, would you do me a favor?
Would you speak to your boss and see what you can swing for us?
I'd really appreciate it.
I'm talking ten minutes, tops.

Joyce Just ring me up, Donald.
And you think this missing boy may have crawled through there?
Well, that was the idea.
Yeah, I just don't see how that'd be possible.
We've got over 100 cameras.
Every square inch covered, plus all my guys.
No one breaks in here.
Certainly not some kid.
Those cameras, you keep the tapes?
If you don't mind me asking, what do you guys do in here?
You're asking the wrong guy.
Staying one step ahead of the Russians? I expect. Something like that.
Who's in charge here? That'd be Dr. Brenner.
And he builds the space lasers?
Space lasers? Ignore him.
This is the night of the 6th and 7th we're seeing here?
That's correct.
Is that it?
Like I said, we would have seen him.
The night of the 7th, we had a search party out for Will.
You remember anything about that night?
Mmm, not much to remember. Called it off.
'Cause of the storm. Yeah, a lot of rain that night.
You see any rain on that tape?
What are you thinking?
I don't know.
But they're lying.
That's why science doesn't make any damn sense to me.
No, I swear. Look at this. It's totally frostbite.
Oh, thanks, man. It's a heated pool.
Well, if it's not frostbite, then what is it?
Ugh, I don't care what it is, it's disgusting!
Get it off the table. We're eating here.
Ew!
Hey, Tommy.
When you left, did you see Barb?
What? Barbara.
She's not here today.
I seriously have no idea who you're talking about.
Come on, don't be an ass, man. Did you...
Did you see her leave last night or not?
No, she was gone when we left.
Probably couldn't stand listening to all that moaning.
Oh, Steve!
Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve! Oh, Steve...
Oh, Steve!
Okay, chill.
Listen... I'm sure she's fine. She's probably just...
she's probably just, like, skipping or something.
Yeah.
Yeah, probably.
How about this one? Too big for the sling.
So, do you think Eleven was born with her powers, like the XMen,
or do you think she acquired them, like... like Green Lantern?
She's not a superhero. She's a weirdo.
Why does that matter? The XMen are weirdos.
If you love her so much, why don't you marry her?
What are you talking about?
Mike, seriously? What?
You look at her all, like...
"""Hi, El! El! El! El!"
I love you so much!
"Would you marry me?"" Shut up, Lucas."
Yeah, shut up, Lucas.
What are you losers doing back here?
Probably looking for their missing friend.
That's not funny. It's serious. He's in danger.
I hate to break it to you, Toothless, but he's not in danger.
He's dead. That's what my dad says.
He said he was probably killed by some other queer.
Come on. Just ignore them.
Watch where you're going, Frogface.
You all right? Yeah.
Hey.
How about this one?
Yeah. Yeah?
Yeah, this is it.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this is the monster killer!
Whoo!
Hey.
Oh, hey.
Hey! Hey, Karen.
Hi...
I brought you a casserole.
Oh! Thank you, uh...
Uh, you wanna... come in?
Hey, Marissa. How you doin'?
You have a lot of nerve showing up here.
What?
You could have at least called, said,
"""Marissa! Hey, it's not gonna work out. Sorry I wasted your time. I'm a dick."""
Yep.
I'm sorry. Uh...
Maybe we could go out again next week?
Newspapers? You guys got newspapers around here?
We have the New York Times, the Post, all the big ones.
Organized by year and topic.
You can find the corresponding microfiche in the reading room.
Okay, we're looking for anything on the Hawkins National Laboratory.
Well, shouldn't you be looking for that missing kid?
Yeah. We are.
Uh, so, why don't you start with the Times,
and we'll check out the Post.
The librarian?
Will always loved Christmas, you know.
So I thought if I... I put the lights up...
I don't know, he...
I'd feel like he was home somehow.
It's silly, I know.
No. No, it's not silly.
How is Jonathan holding up?
You know, he's good at taking care of himself.
He always has been, you know?
I...
I mean, he thinks I'm losing my mind, but...
Is something the matter?
Uh, no.
No, I just...
We're having electrical problems.
Joyce.
I want you to know something.
If you need anything, anything at all...
Ted and I are here for you.
Thank you. Thanks.
Okay.
How... how's Mike dealing with this?
Is he, uh, okay?
Mike? Uh... I don't know.
He skipped school yesterday.
He's never done anything like that before.
Let me throw in that casserole, okay?
Oh, where's Holly?
Hey!
She shouldn't be here.
Oh, I'm sorry. She's quite the explorer these days.
Wait, did you see something? Yeah.
What did... what did you see? Tell me.
What did you see? What Joyce... Joyce!
Listen... Karen, thank you for the casserole,
but I need you to leave.
Okay?
Come on, come on, come on...
Hello? Hi.
Hi, uh, Ms. Holland, it's Nancy.
Oh, Nancy, how are you?
Good. I'm good.
Um, I was just wondering, uh, is Barb there?
Mmm... No, she hasn't come home yet.
But she did come home, right? After the vigil?
No, she said she was staying with you last night.
Right, yes. She did, sorry.
I meant, did she come home this morning?
I think she left some textbooks and she was gonna go pick them up.
Oh, um, no, I haven't seen her.
Do Do you know what? I just remembered... she's at the library.
Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her?
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
Sorry to bother you.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
Nicole here was, uh, telling us about your work.
We've heard great things. Yeah, sounds cool.
And we'd just love to take a look. You know, as... connoisseurs of art.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, no? Oh... Hey.
Please, give me my bag. No, just...
Man, he is totally trembling. He must really have something to hide.
Here we go.
Ah...
Here we go.
Oh, man. Let me see.
Dude.
Yeah, this isn't creepy at all.
I was looking for my brother. No.
No, this is called stalking. Mmmhmm.
What's going on? Here's the starring lady.
What?
This creep was spying on us last night.
He was probably gonna save this one for later.
See, you can tell that he knows it was wrong, but...
Man, that's the thing about perverts...
It's hardwired into 'em.
You know, they just can't help themselves.
So...
we'll just have to take away his toy.
Steve... No, please, not the camera.
No, no, wait, wait... Tommy, Tommy.
It's okay.
Here you go, man.
Come on, let's go. The game's about to start.
Boo.
Bye.
Hey, Nance!
Come on.
Threeonefive.
Threeonefive.
Threeonefive.
No! No!
Papa! Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
Papa!
No!
Incredible.
El!
You okay?
Hop on. We only have a few hours.
So, I told Mr. Mundy...
"""The solution of ten plus Y equals..."
"blow me."""
Bull, if you did that, you'd be in detention right now.
Saturday.
I bet Mr. Mundy's still a virgin.
Oh, he's so a virgin!
Maybe you should blow him, Carol. Help your grades a bit.
Whoa, Nance, where you going?
I totally forgot.
I told my mom I would, um...
I would do something with her.
Well, what do you mean? The game's about to start.
I'm sorry.
What the hell's wrong with her?
Maybe she freaked out when you went all psycho on the psycho.
Oh, give me a break.
What'd you expect, dating Miss Perfect?
Why did they hurt you?
What?
Oh, that.
Uh...
I just fell at recess.
Mike... Yeah?
Friends tell the truth.
I was tripped by this mouth breather, Troy, okay?
Mouth breather?
Yeah, you know...
a dumb person.
A knucklehead.
Knucklehead?
I don't know why I just didn't tell you. Everyone at school knows.
I just didn't want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know?
Mike... Yeah?
I understand.
Oh.
Okay, cool.
Cool.
Barb?
Barb!
Barb?
Barb?
Barb?
Oh!
Will... are you here?
Okay, good, good, good, good.
Are you...
Um, blink once for yes, twice for no.
Can you do that for me, sweetie?
Can you do...
Oh, good boy. Good boy.
Baby, I need to know...
Are you alive?
Are you safe?
I need to know where to find you, honey. Where... where are you?
Can you... can you tell me where you are?
Can you...
Please, baby. I need to find you. Tell me what to do.
Please just...
Will...
Hey! You're home early! How was the game?
Nancy? What's the matter?
It's Barb.
I think...
something happened.
Something terrible.
I don't know, Chief.
What don't you know?
This lady, Terry Ives, sounds like a real nut to me.
Her kid was taken for LSD mind control experiments?
She's been discredited.
Claim was thrown out
Okay, forget about her.
Take a look at this.
Dr. Martin Brenner. Who?
Brenner.
He runs Hawkins Lab.
Okay.
You don't find that interesting?
Not really.
He was involved in some hippie crap back in the day, so what?
No, this isn't hippie crap. This is CIAsanctioned research.
Doesn't mean he had anything to do with our kid.
Come on. Look at that. Hospital gowns. All of 'em.
Now, that piece of fabric that the teacher found by the pipe.
That sure looked like a hospital gown to me, huh?
Am I wrong? I don't know, Chief.
Come on, man.
Work with me here.
I'm not saying that there's some grand conspiracy.
I'm just...
I'm saying maybe something happened.
Maybe Will was in the wrong place at the wrong time
and he saw something that he shouldn't have.
It's a reach. It's a start.
Hey, Powell, is the chief with you?
Hopper here. What do you got?
Here.
Yeah, this is where Will lives.
Hiding.
No, no, this is where he lives.
He's missing from here. Understand?
What are we doing here? She said he's hiding here.
Um... no!
I swear, if we walked all the way out here for nothing
That's exactly what we did.
I told you she didn't know what the hell she was talking about!
Why did you bring us here?
Mike, don't waste your time with her. What do you want to do then?
Call the cops, like we should have done yesterday.
We are not calling the cops! Hey, guys?
What other choice do we have? Guys!
Will...
Okay.
Okay, baby, talk to me.
Talk to me. Where are you?
"""R."" Good, good, good, good."
That's good. Come on, come on.
"""I..."
G...
H... T...
H...
E...
"R... E..."""
"""Right here."""
"""Right here""?"
I don't know what that means.
I need you to tell me what to do.
What should I do?
How do I get to you? How do I find you? What should I do?
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God. Please tell me it's not the kid.
It's not Will. It can't be.
It's Will. It's really Will.
Mike...
"""Mike""? ""Mike,"" what?"
You were supposed to help us find him alive.
You said he was alive!
Why did you lie to us?
What's wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
Mike... What?
Mike, come on. Don't do this, man.
Mike...
Mike, where are you going? Mike!
Mike!
Mom?
Mom, what happened?
It's okay.
Hey.
Michael?
What's wrong?
This the wall she was talking about, Chief?
A trooper found something in the, uh...
water that's at the quarry.
Our working theory right now is that Will...
crashed his bike, he... made his way over the quarry and, uh...
accidentally fell in.
The earth must have given way.
Joyce?
Joyce?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
No.
Whoever you found...
is not my boy.
It's not Will. Joyce.
No, you don't understand.
I talked to him...
a half hour ago.
He was... He was here.
He was... He was talking with these.
Talking? Uhhuh.
One blink for yes, two for no.
And... And, uh...
And then I made this so he could talk to me.
'Cause he was hiding...
from that... that thing.
The thing that came out of the wall?
The thing that chased you? Yeah.
Yeah. Mom, come on, please.
You've gotta stop this. No, maybe he's...
It's after him!
He's in danger. We have to find him! We What exactly was this thing?
It was some kind of animal, you said?
Uh, no, it was...
It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It...
It had these long arms and... it didn't have a face.
It didn't have a face?
Joyce. It didn't have a face...
Joyce, listen to me.
Listen to me.
After Sarah...
I saw her, too.
And I heard her.
I didn't know what was real.
And then I figured out that it was in my mind.
And I had to pack all that away.
Otherwise, I was gonna fall down a hole...
that I couldn't get out of.
No, you're... you're talking about grief.
This is different.
I'm just saying that you No, I know what you're saying, Hop.
I swear to you, I know what I saw.
And I'm not crazy.
I'm not saying that you're crazy.
No... You are.
And I understand, but...
God, I...
I need you to believe me.
Please.
Please.
Listen...
I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself.
It'll give you the answers that you need.
But tonight... Oh, God.
...I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.
Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry
by state police earlier this evening.
It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark.
The state police are mounting an investigation
to determine Byers' cause of death,
but an initial inquiry...
Should I go down and talk to Michael?
Give him time.
He'll come to us when he's ready.
Can you please stop that?
Are you deaf?
I thought we were friends, you know?
But friends tell each other the truth.
And they definitely don't lie to each other.
You made me think Will was okay, that he was still out there,
but he wasn't. He wasn't!
Maybe you thought you were helping, but you weren't.
You hurt me. Do you understand?
What you did sucks.
Lucas was right about you.
All along.

Over.
Will, are you there?
Will!
Was that...
Was it...
Will.
Mom...
Mom!
Mom! Wake up.
What... what time is it?
It's almost 8:00. We have to go.
Go where? Where?
To see Will.
Michael?
Hi, honey. How are you feeling?
I, uh...
I don't think I can go to school today.
Oh, that's fine, sweetie.
I need to drop off Nance, then I'm gonna check in on Barb's parents.
Why don't you grab a book or something and come with me?
We can stop by the video store on the way back,
pick out whatever you want. Even Rrated.
I think I just want to stay home today.
I mean, if that's okay?
Well, are you sure you're gonna be all right here by yourself?
I think so.
Okay.
But if you need anything, call Dad at work.
Okay. Okay.
Bye.
Bye, sweetie.
Lucas, do you copy?
Lucas, come on, I know you're there!
This is urgent. I'm serious.
I'm not gonna stop until you answer.
Lucas.
Lucas!
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas...
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas, Lucas
Go away, Mike.
I'm not in the mood, all right? Over and out.
"No, not ""out."""
I'm not messing around, okay? This is about Will.
Over. What about Will?
You mean about his funeral? Over.
No, not his funeral.
Screw his funeral! What?
Just get over here stat. And bring Dustin.
Over and out.
What's taking so long?
Well, everything's been a bit chaotic around here without Gary.
Without Gary?
Where's Gary? Well, I thought you knew.
Those men from State, they... they sent Gary home last night.
So who did the autopsy?
Someone from State.
He has a birth mark on his right arm.
Can you show that to me, please?
How's your mom doing?
I don't know.
How long's this stuff been going on? With the lights and, uh...
Will and the thing in the wall?
Since the first phone call, I guess.
You know, she's had anxiety problems...
in the past.
But this...
I don't know.
I'm worried it could be...
Ugh, I don't know.
She'll be okay.
We'll be okay.
My mom...
she's tough.
Yeah, she is.
Hey.
She is.
Ma'am!
Ma'am, I need you to sign! I don't...
I don't know what you think that thing is in there, but that is not my son!
Joyce, wait a second. No!
Mom! Ma'am, I Ma'am!
So, wait a sec. I don't understand. You went back to my house?
To look for Barb.
Yeah, okay, but why didn't you just talk to me?
That's crazy.
I don't know, I... I was scared.
You seriously think you saw a guy in a mask
just hanging out in my yard?
I don't think it was a mask.
But he had no face?
I don't know!
I don't know, I just...
I have a terrible feeling about this.
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.
What?
The cops...
they're gonna want to talk to all of us now.
Tommy, Carol, everybody who was at the party.
So? My parents are gonna murder me!
Are you serious right now?
You don't understand. My dad's a gradeA asshole.
Barb is missing! And you're worried about your dad?
Okay, just... When you talk to the cops, just...
don't mention the beers.
It's just gonna get us both in trouble,
and Barbara's got nothing to do with it, okay?
I can't believe you right now.
I can't believe you. Nancy.
Nancy, wait!
Nancy!
Mom, will you get in? No, I...
I need to think. Just go on home.
Mom, will you just get in, please?
Mom.
Mom!
Mom.
Stop. Just go home, Jonathan.
No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down.
Shut down? What... We have to deal with this, Mom.
We have to deal with the funeral!
The funeral?
For... for who? For that thing back there?
Okay, let me get this straight.
Will, that's not his body, because he's in the lights, right?
And there's a monster in the wall?
Do you even hear yourself?
I know it sounds crazy.
I sound crazy!
Yeah. You think I don't know that?
It is crazy!
But I heard him, Jonathan.
He talked to me!
Will is... is calling to me!
And he's out there, and he's alone, and he's scared, and I...
I don't care if anyone believes me!
I am not gonna stop looking for him until I find him and bring him home.
I am going to bring him home!
Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights,
the rest of us are having a funeral for Will!
I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day!
All right, show's over.
What?
We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right?
Yeah, I heard a baby.
What?
Mike, you obviously tapped into a baby monitor.
It's probably the Blackburns' next door.
Uh, did that sound like a baby to you?
That was Will! Mike...
Lucas, you don't understand. He spoke last night.
Words!
He was singing that weird song he loves. Even El heard him!
Oh, well, if the weirdo heard him, then I guess
Are you sure you're on the right channel?
I don't think it's about that.
I think, somehow, she's channeling him.
Like... like Professor X. Yeah.
Are you actually believing this crap?
I don't know, I mean...
Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger?
He sounded a lot like that.
Did you guys not see what I saw?
They pulled Will's body out of the water.
He's dead!
Well, maybe it's his ghost. Maybe he's haunting us.
It's not his ghost. So how do you know that?
I just do! Then what was in that water?
I don't know!
All I know is Will is alive.
Will is alive!
He's out there somewhere.
All we have to do is find him.
This isn't gonna work.
We need to get El to a stronger radio.
Mr. Clarke's Heathkit ham shack. Yeah.
The Heathkit's at school.
There is no way we're gonna get the weirdo in there without anyone noticing.
I mean... look at her.
Wow.
She looks Pretty.
Good.
You look pretty good.
Pretty.
Good.
Clear.
You boys hear me all right in there? Loud and clear, Shepard.
Good luck in there, son.
"""The brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness,"

"And Kurtz's life was running swiftly, too"""
Nancy Wheeler?
If you'll come with me, please?
This argument you and Barbara had?
What exactly was it about?
It wasn't really an argument.
Barb just wanted to leave.
I didn't, so, I...
I told her to just go home.
Then what?
Then I went upstairs to put on some dry clothes.
And the next day, you went back and...
saw a bear, you're thinking?
I don't know what it was, but...
I think...
I think maybe it took Barb.
You need to check behind Steve's house We did.
There's nothing there.
There's no sign of a bear. And no car.
What? Look.
We figure that Barbara came back last night
and then she took off, went somewhere else.
Has she ever talked to you about running off?
Leaving town, maybe?
No.
No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.
She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy?
Uh, Steve Harrington?
What? No!
Maybe she was jealous because she saw you go up to Steve's room?
It wasn't like that.
Like what?
Steve and me, we're... we're just friends.
We... we just talked.
Now was this before or after you changed out of your clothes?
So, Gary, tell me about these troopers that brought in Will.
It was about six of 'em, I'd say.
They're all Staties?
Yes, sir.
Never seen that many troopers come with a body before.
They told you that they were gonna take care of the autopsy, huh?
Yeah. Claimed jurisdiction. Kicked me out.
Well, it all seemed a bit over the top to me, considering...
Considering what?
Considering this was Will Byers and not John F. Kennedy.
Thanks for stopping by, Gary. Sure thing.
...let the people know that, uh, the troopers are on duty
and you should be safe, because we think this is just an isolated incident.
State trooper David O'Bannon, thank you so much for your help.
Thank you, sir. Back to you...
Okay, remember, if anyone sees us, look sad.
Attention students,
there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.
Do not go to fourth period.
It's locked.
What? Hey, do you think you can open it?
With your powers?
Boys?
Hey.
Assembly's about to start.
We know. We're just, you know...
Upset.
Yeah, definitely upset.
We need some alone time.
To cry. Yeah, listen...
I get it. I do.
I know how hard this is, but let's just be there for Will, huh?
And then...
the Heathkit is all yours for the rest of the day.
What do you say?
I don't believe we've met. What's your name?
Eleven Eleanor! She's my, uh
Cousin. Second cousin.
She's here for Will's funeral.
Ah, well, welcome to Hawkins Middle, Eleanor.
I wish you were here under better circumstances.
Thank you.
Uh, where are you from exactly?
Bad place
Sweden! I have a lot of Swedish family.
She hates it there. Cold!
Subzero.
Shall we? Yep!
At times like these...
it is important that we come together as a community.
We come
Abort.
We come together to heal...
we come together to grieve...
You lied to the police! I didn't lie!
How naive do you think I am?
You and Steve were just talking?
We slept together!
Is that what you want to know? It doesn't matter!
It does matter! No! It is all bullshit!
It has nothing to do with Barb and she's missing.
And something terrible happened to her. I know it.
I know it!
And no one is listening to me!
Sweetie, sweetie, I'm listening.
I'm listening to you No! You're not!
Nancy... Nancy!
Just leave me alone!
Try him again.
Shepard, come in. Confirm comm.
Shepard, come in. Confirm comm.
This is Shepard. Confirming, over.
Shepard. Where are you?
Can you describe to us what it is you see? Over.
It's low visibility. I'm about one click south of the rift.
Everything's still here, but it's all eroded. Covered in blood...
Shepard? Do you copy?
Shepard? Can you hear me?
There's something else... There's something else in here!
Reel him in.
Reel him back in! Get him in.
Come on, come on! Faster!
There's something else in here!
Pull me out! Pull me out, pull me out!
Pull me out! Pull me out!
Shepard, come in. Over. Comms are down, sir.
Shepard, come in! Over.
Will Byers' death is an unimaginable tragedy.
Will was an exceptional student and a wonderful friend to all of us.
It's impossible to express the hole his loss will leave in our community.
I'd like to introduce you to Sandy Sloane.
She's a local grief counselor from the church over in Jonesboro.
But before she comes up here,
I just want those of you who are having trouble dealing with this tragic loss...
Look at these fakers.
They probably didn't even know his name till today.
What?
Who is interested in this? This is so stupid.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...
Oh, he was such a great student.
Oh, he's going to leave a hole in the community.
Mouth breather.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, Troy!
Hey, Troy!
You... you think this is funny?
What'd you say, Wheeler?
I saw you guys laughing over there.
And I think that's a real messed up thing to do.
Didn't you listen to the counselor, Wheeler?
Grief shows itself in funny ways.
Besides, what's there to be sad about, anyway?
Will's in fairyland now, right?
Flying around with all the other little fairies.
All happy and gay!
You're dead, Wheeler!
Dead!
Dude, Troy peed himself.
Holy shit!
Hey! What's going on here?
Oh.
Mike! Let's go!
It's made of soft wood with a crepe interior.
Uh, now, I... I don't know what your budget is,
but over here, we... we have copper and bronze.
Can you just give me a second?
Of course.
Hey.
Hey.
Your mom, um... she said you'd be here.
I just...
Can we talk for a second?
It looks like it could be some kind of perspective distortion,
but I wasn't using the wide angle.
I don't know.
It's weird.
And you're sure you didn't see anyone else out there?
No.
And she was there one second and then, um...
gone.
I figured she bolted.
The cops think that she ran away.
But they don't know Barb.
And I went back to Steve's...
and I thought I...
saw something.
Some...
weird man or...
I don't know what it was.
I'm sorry.
I... I shouldn't have come here today. I'm...
I'm so sorry.
What'd he look like?
What?
This man you saw in the woods.
What'd he look like?
I don't know.
It was almost like he...
he didn't have
Didn't have a face?
How did you know that?
Aw, come on!
Another, please.
And another for my, uh, friend here.
Oh, thanks, man. Appreciate it.
Yeah, that's all right. I'm, uh... I'm celebrating.
My daughter, she won the spelling bee today.
Is that right?
Yeah, that's right.
"""Odontalgia."""
That was the word.
You know what it means?
It's a fancy name for a toothache.
Yeah, she's smart. She's real smart. Don't know where she gets it from.
I've been tryin' to figure that out for years.
Your daughter, she got a name?
What?
Your daughter? What's her name?
Sarah.
Her name's Sarah.
To Sarah.
I recognize you.
Are you famous or somethin'?
Uh, you might have seen me on TV, I, uh... I found that Byers boy.
So, you on that case or what?
I just saw him on patrol, you know?
Dumb luck.
So that quarry, that's, uh...
that's staterun, where they found the boy, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, that's funny.
'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company.
Frank Sattler? Decent guy, still got a couple operational quarries up in Roane.
Is that right? Yeah.
That's right.
So why are you lying to me, man?
What's your problem, bud?
I don't have a problem.
I'm just a concerned citizen.
Yeah?
Well, stick your nose someplace else.
The kid is dead.
End of story.
Thanks for ruining the game, dick.
Okay...
Let's try this one more time.
Who told you to be out there?
What were you doing out there?
I don't know! I don't know. They...
they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close.
Get close to what?
The body.
Who do you work for?
The NSA? Hawkins Lab?
Who is that?
You're gonna get us both killed. Who is that?
Hey! Hey!
Come on! Come on!
Talk to me!
I know you're here!
Come on.
Now what? She'll find him.
Right, El?
Eleven?
Are you listening?
That man before you...
I need you to find him.
Hurt him? No.
No, I don't want you to hurt him.
I want you to listen to him.
Listen? Yes.
I want you to listen to what he says and repeat his words back to me.
Just like we used to with those old nursery rhymes.
Do you remember?
Hmm?
Do you think you can do that for me?
Mmmhmm. Good.
Begin.
Amulet.
Frigid.
Evolve.
Airplane.
Eleven?
Repeat the words.
Apricot.
Peninsula.
Game.
Enchantment.
Mouse.
Balloon.
She's doing it.
She's finding him! This is crazy.
Calm down. She just closed her eyes.
Holy...
What is that?
Mom?
Will?
Mom?
No way!
Mom... Will!
Please...
Will!
Will!
Will...
Will!
Mom! Will!
I'm here! I'm here!
Oh, God... Mom!
Will! Will, it's us! Are you there?
Can you hear us? We're here!
Hello? Mom?
Why can't he hear us?
I don't know!
Baby...
Mom? Oh, God. Will!
Mom!
Oh, thank God.
Baby...
Will...
Mom...
Mom, it's coming!
Tell me where you are! How do I get to you?
It's like home, but it's so dark...
It's so dark and empty. And it's cold!
Mom? Mom!
Listen to me! I swear I'm gonna get to you, okay?
But right now, I need you to hide.
Mom, please!
No, no, listen! Listen, I...
I will find you, but you have to run now!
Run! Run!
El, are you okay? Oh!
Can you move?
Here, help her up.
This way!
And you're...
Brightening. Enlarging.
Hmm.
Did your mom say anything else?
Like, um, where it might have gone to, or...
No, just that it came out of the wall.
How long does this take?
Not long.
Have you been...
doing this a while?
What?
Photography?
Yeah.
I guess I'd rather observe people than, you know...
Talk to them.
I know. It's weird.
No!
No, it is.
It's just, sometimes...
people don't really say what they're really thinking.
But you capture the right moment...
it says more.
What was I saying?
What?
When you took my picture.
I shouldn't have taken that.
I'm, uh...
I'm sorry.
It's just
That's it.
That's what I saw.
My mom...
I thought she was crazy
'cause she said...
that's not Will's body. That he's alive.
And if he's alive Then Barbara.
Hey, Patty! Hey, uh, need something, Chief?
Oh, you know, I forgot my hat. Oh.
I'll just be a minute.
Hey, I love that book. It's a nasty mutt.
Hey, you can't be back here.
Yeah, I just got off the line with O'Bannon.
He said that he needs to see you at the station.
It's some emergency... What the hell are you talking about?
I don't work with O'Bannon.
Did I say O'Bannon? I meant...
Okay.
Babe...
Jesus, the hell happened?
Lonnie.
Thanks.
No.
Hands up. Hands up!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forgot all the cameras, bub?
Look, Dr. Brenner asked for me specifically. Okay?
How else do you think I got in here?
What's your name again?
It's Jim Hopper.
Chief Jim Hopper.
Yeah, I've got Jim Hopper
Come again?
Hey...
you mind if I borrow this one?
Drink.
It'll calm your nerves.
Help you think straight, yeah?
I don't know what to do.
I know. I know.
This whole time...
I... I could... I could feel him.
He was...
He was so close. He was... he was right there.
I knew he was alive.
Our hands... our hands were almost touching.
Now it's like I... uh...
God, it's like I can't feel him anymore.
Don't look at me like that. Like what?
Like how everybody is looking at me.
Like I'm out of my damn mind. Hey.
You're not gonna like this,
but I think you need to seriously consider the possibility that all this...
It's in your head.
You remember your Aunt Darlene? No.
No, this is not that.
I mean, when something like this happens,
your mind makes up stuff for you to cope, you know?
I mean, Jesus, there's a funeral tomorrow for our little boy
and you're saying his body is fake.
He's in the wall.
I mean, how do you explain that?
It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't.
At least go talk to a shrink or...
What about Pastor Charles or someone I don't Well, they can't help.
Joyce, you just told me...
that Will is gone.
What else is there to do?
Hey.
Will?
Will?
Will?
Will?
What was Will saying?
Like home... Like home...
but dark?
And empty.
Empty and cold. Wait, did he say cold?
I don't know. The stupid radio kept going in and out.
It's like riddles in the dark.
Like home. Like his house?
Or maybe like Hawkins.
Upside down.
What'd she say? Upside down.
What? Upside down.
When El showed us where Will was, she flipped the board over, remember?
Upside down.
Dark. Empty.
Do you understand what he's talking about?
No. Guys, come on, think about it.
When El took us to find Will, she took us to his house, right?
Yeah. And he wasn't there.
But what if he was there?
What if we just couldn't see him?
What if he was on the other side?
What if this is Hawkins and...
this is where Will is?
The Upside Down.
Like the Vale of Shadows.
Will?
Will?
Will?
I see him! Hey! Stop!
"""The Vale of Shadows"
is a dimension that is a dark reflection or echo of our world.
"It is a place of decay and death."""
Will?
"""A plane out of phase. A place of monsters."
"It is right next to you, and you don't even see it."""
Will?
Will?
An alternate dimension.
But... how... how do we get there?
You cast Shadow Walk.
In real life, dummy.
We can't shadow walk, but...
maybe she can.
Do you know how we get there? To the Upside Down?
Oh, my God!
What the hell?
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey, kid.
What's going on?
Your dad's, uh, gonna stay here tonight. On the couch.
Yeah, I'm here as long as you need me, okay?
How are you holding up?
What happened?
Don't worry about that. Mom...
that thing you saw before, did it come back?
Jonathan, that's enough.
Can we talk?
Alone?
You need to leave. Look, I know you're upset.
We all are.
But you need to listen to me. Your mother is sick. Really sick.
Yeah. Well, you being here,
you're just making things worse, like always.
Worse? Yeah!
She took down that wall with an ax.
She said that Will was inside and that he's talking to her.
Yeah. Maybe he was.
This isn't some kind of joke.
Your mom was half frozen to death when I got here.
Trembling, scared out of her mind.
You come in here and you start feeding into her hallucinations
or whatever the hell you want to call it,
you're gonna push her right over the edge.
You hear me?
Look, I'm on your side.
I'm here to help.
I'm gonna make things better around here for all of us.
Thank God you're here.
Do me a favor. At the funeral tomorrow, just behave.
If not for me, for your mother.
Take that down. It's inappropriate.
Good. Ah! Dad, you're... you're choking me.
Ah... there. It's supposed to be a little tight.
Looks good.
Here we go.
You look nice, sweetie.
Anything else?
You can borrow my black heels if you want.
The ones you wore to Cathy's birthday.
I'm fine. Thanks.
Ugh.
Come on. Time to go.
Come on.
"""Fear not, for I am with you."
Be not dismayed, for I am your God.
I will strengthen you.
Yes, I will help you.
"I will uphold you with my righteous right hand."""
It's times like these that our faith is challenged.
How, if He is truly benevolent...
could God take from us someone so young, so innocent?
It would be easy to turn away from God...
but we must remember that nothing,
not even tragedy, can separate us from His love.
We are here today to find comfort in the truth of scripture,
and to surround Will and his family...
Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral.
I'm so, so sorry. Oh, thank you so much for coming.
Yeah, if there's anything we can do...
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
Take care, all right? Thanks.
Thanks for coming out.
I see Will the Wise is back.
What's that shooting out of his cane?
Fireballs.
I couldn't find the red crayon, so that's why it's green.
Oh, well...
if he's so wise, why does he need fireballs?
Why can't he just, you know, outsmart the bad guys?
Most of the time, yeah, totally.
But... sometimes the bad guys are smart, too.
You know?
Yeah.
So he needs the fireballs?
Well, yeah, to burn them to a crisp.
All right. Well, I don't know who's been raising you,
but I'm gonna get you some new crayons
because it looks like he's shooting cabbages.
Will! Will, it's us! Are you there?
Can you hear us? We're here!
Hello? Mom?
Why can't he hear us? I don't know!
Mom, it's coming!
She was there.
This is where we know for sure it's been, right?
So, that's... Steve's house.
And that's the woods where they found Will's bike and...
that's my house.
It's all so close. Yeah. Exactly.
I mean, it's all within a mile or something.
Whatever this thing is, it's... it's not traveling far.
You want to go out there.
We might not find anything.
I found something.
And if we do see it...
then what?
We kill it.
What are you doing? Just give me a second.
Are you serious?
What? You want to find this thing and take another photo? Yell at it?
This is a terrible idea.
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.
What? You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.
You know that.
Your mom would.
She's been through enough. She deserves to know.
Yeah, and I'll tell her...
when this thing is dead.
I don't know what in the world caused it.
Let's take a look, huh? Yeah.
Mr. Clarke says he's never seen anything like it.
Mr. Clarke?
Yeah, he runs the AV Club.
That right?
Apparently, some of the less athletic types go nuts for this stuff.
Mr. Clarke?
Oh, hey, there.
How are you boys holding up?
We're... in... mourning.
Man, these aren't real Nilla Wafers.
We were wondering if you had time to talk?
We have some questions. A lot of questions.
So, you know how in Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks about other dimensions?
Like, beyond our world?
Yeah, sure. Theoretically.
Right, theoretically.
So, theoretically, how do we travel there?
You guys have been thinking about
Hugh Everett's ManyWorlds Interpretation, haven't you?
Well, basically, there are parallel universes.
Just like our world,
but just infinite variations of it.
Which means there's a world out there
where none of this tragic stuff ever happened.
Yeah, that's not what we're talking about.
Oh. We were thinking of more
of an evil dimension, like the Vale of Shadows.
You know the Vale of Shadows?
An echo of the Material Plane, where necrotic and shadow magic
Yeah, exactly.
If that did exist, a place like the Vale of Shadows,
how would we travel there?
Theoretically. Well...
Picture... an acrobat...
standing on a tightrope.
Now, the tightrope is our dimension.
And our dimension has rules.
You can move forwards, or backwards.
But, what if...
right next to our acrobat, there is a flea?
Now, the flea can also travel back and forth, just like the acrobat.
Right? Right.
Here's where things get really interesting.
The flea can also travel this way...
along the side of the rope.
He can even go...
underneath the rope.
Upside down. Exactly.
But we're not the flea, we're the acrobat.
In this metaphor, yes, we're the acrobat.
So we can't go upside down?
No.
Well, is there any way for the acrobat to get to the Upside Down?
Well... you'd have to create a massive amount of energy.
More than humans are currently capable of creating, mind you,
to open up some kind of tear in time and space,
and then...
you create a doorway.
Like a gate? Sure. Like a gate.
But again, this is all Theoretical.
But... but what if this gate already existed?
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.
It would disrupt gravity,
the magnetic field, our environment.
Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.
Science is neat.
But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.
Whoa.
Hey, Chief!
Hello? Whoa! Hey!
Jesus, Chief. You all right? What are you doing here?
We tried calling, but Yeah, the phone's dead.
Hey, so Bev Mooney came in this morning all upset.
Said that Dale and Henry went hunting yesterday...
and they didn't come back home.
She thought they were on another binger, but she's not so sure now.
I think this whole Will Byers thing has everybody on edge.
Where was this? It was at the station.
No, no. Where did Henry and Dale go hunting?
Oh. Uh, out near Kerley.
Mirkwood.
What?
Okay.
You go back to the station. I'll take care of this, all right?
Are you sure? Yeah, leave it.
Oh, hey. Uh, they found Barbara's car. What?
Barbara Holland's car. Seems she ran away after all.
Staties found it late last night at a bus station.
Funny, right? They keep doing our job for us.
Yeah. It's funny.
Is he off his meds again?
He's been spending too much time with Joyce Byers.
That's what I think.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?
You want to freeze to death all winter?
I told you not to take these down. They were in the way, babe.
How long are you gonna keep those up? I mean, really?
You know, it's a shame what they've done to this family.
What? The Sattler Company.
I went to the quarry on the way over here.
I just wanted to look around, you know?
Couldn't believe it. I just couldn't believe it.
No warning signs, no fence, no nothing.
Ought to be held accountable if you ask me.
It would take a lot of energy to build a gate like this.
But that's got to be what happened.
Otherwise, how'd Will get there, right? Right.
What we want to know is, do you know where the gate is?
Then how do you know about the Upside Down?
Dustin, what are you doing? Dustin?
Dustin! Dustin!
I... I need to see your compasses. What?
Your compasses. All of your compasses, right now!
What's exciting about this?
Well, they're all facing north, right? Yeah, so?
Well, that's not true north. What do you mean?
I mean exactly what I just said. That's not true north.
Are you both seriously this dense?
The sun rises in the east, and it sets in the west. Right?
Which means that's true north.
So what you're saying is the compasses are broken.
Do you even understand how a compass works?
Do you see a battery pack on this? No.
No, you don't. Because it doesn't need one.
The needle's naturally drawn to the Earth's magnetic North Pole.
So what's wrong with them?
Well, that's what I couldn't figure out, but then I remembered.
You can change the direction of a compass with a magnet.
If there's the presence of a more powerful magnetic field,
the needle deflects to that power.
And then I remembered what Mr. Clarke said.
The gate would have so much power
It could disrupt the electromagnetic field.
Exactly.
Meaning, if we follow the compasses' north...
They should lead us to the gate.
Whoa, whoa, hey, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing here? What are you doing?
Nothing. I hope that's not meant for me.
What? No.
Oh, no, I was just...
thinking about joining softball. Oh.
Well, uh...
listen, I'm really sorry.
I mean, even before you threatened me with the baseball bat.
Okay.
I panicked and...
I mean, I was a total dick. Yeah, you were.
Did you get in trouble with your parents?
Totally, but...
you know, who cares? Screw 'em.
Any news about Barbara?
Parents heard from her? Or... No.
Hey, listen.
Why don't we, uh, why don't we catch a movie tonight, you know?
Just kinda pretend everything's normal for a few hours.
All The Right Moves is still playing.
You know, with your lover boy from Risky Business?
Yeah, I know.
You know, Carol thinks I actually kinda look like him.
What do you think? Huh?
♪ Just take those old records Off the shelf ♪
♪ I'll sit and listen to them by myself ♪
I just, I... I don't think I can.
I've been really busy with this whole funeral thing and...
with my brother.
It's been really hard on him.
Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah, yeah.
So...
I should go.
Sorry.
I'll call you later. Is that okay?
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
♪ Just take those old records Off the shelf ♪
♪ I'll sit and listen to them... ♪
You were here for the money! No!
The money! Admit it!
You aren't here 'cause of Will. You never cared about him. You never did!
Jesus, Joyce, it was his funeral today. Do we have to do this right now?
I can't believe I fell for this. I'm here to help, Joyce.
To help? We could use that money for good.
Oh, like maybe to pay off your debts?
To pay for Jonathan to go to school!
Oh, don't do that. Do what?
Lie to me! I'm not lying to you!
Yeah, well, where does he wanna go?
Huh? What?
Where does Jonathan want to go to college?
We get that money, anywhere he damn well pleases!
NYU, Lonnie!
He's wanted to go to NYU since he was six years old!
So then he goes to NYU!
Get out.
Get out!
You need me here, Joyce.
Oh, brother, I have not needed you for a long time!
Oh, no? Look what happened.
Oh, don't you dare.
At least I was here! Oh, come on, Joyce.
Just look around at this place.
All your Christmas lights.
What the hell am I supposed to think? You're such a great mom? You're a mess!
Maybe I am a mess. Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe I'm out of my mind!
But, God help me, I will keep these lights up until the day I die
if I think there's a chance that Will's still out there!
Now, get out!
Get out of my house!
You're supposed to hit the cans, right?
No, actually, you see the spaces in between the cans?
I'm aiming for those.
Ah.
You ever shot a gun before?
Have you met my parents?
Yeah, I haven't shot one since I was ten.
My dad took me hunting on my birthday.
He made me kill a rabbit.
A rabbit? Yeah.
I guess he thought it would make me into more of a man or something.
I cried for a week.
Jesus.
What? I'm a fan of Thumper.
I meant your dad.
Yeah.
I guess he and my mother loved each other at some point, but...
...I wasn't around for that part.
Um, yeah.
Just, uh, point and shoot.
I don't think my parents ever loved each other.
They must've married for some reason.
My mom was young.
My dad was older,
but he had a cushy job, money, came from a good family.
So they bought a nice house at the end of the culdesac...
and started their nuclear family.
Screw that.
Yeah.
Screw that.
Hello? Hey.
Jim?
Yeah.
Why are you calling me here? I told you not to call me.
I know, I know, I know. I just wanted to...
I just wanted to hear your voice and, uh...
I just wanted to say that, um...
even after everything that happened, I don't...
I don't regret any of it.
And those seven years, they were... everything to me.
Have you been drinking?
No.
No.
Honey, hey...
Hey, it's okay... it's okay.
You know what, actually, I have been drinking, I'm sorry.
Jim, I can't...
Just take care of yourself, okay?
Say hi to Bill for me.
Are you sure
How much further?
I don't know. These only tell direction, not distance.
You really need to learn more about compasses.
I'm just saying.
How do we know when we get to the gate?
Uh, I think a portal to another dimension is gonna be pretty obvious.
Do you think she's acting weird?
You're asking if the weirdo is acting weird?
I mean, weirder than normal?
I don't know. Who cares?
How far, Papa?
Farther than we've ever gone before.
The bath? Yes.
Yes, the bath.
Is that okay?
Okay.
Mike.
Yeah?
Turn back.
What? Why?
I'm tired.
Look, I'm sure we're almost there. Just hold on a little longer, okay?
You never said what I was saying.
What?
Yesterday.
You said I was saying something and that's why you took my picture.
Oh, uh...
I don't know.
My guess...
I saw this girl, you know, trying to be someone else.
But for that moment...
it was like you were alone, or you thought you were.
And, you know, you could just be yourself.
That is such bullshit.
What?
I am not trying to be someone else.
Just because I'm dating Steve and you don't like him
You know what? Forget it. I just thought it was a good picture.
He's actually a good guy.
Okay.
Yesterday, with the camera...
He's not like that at all.
He was just being protective.
Yeah, that's one word for it.
Oh, and I guess what you did was okay?
No, I... I never said that.
He had every right to be pissed
Okay, all right. Does that mean I have to like him?
No.
Listen, don't take it so personally, okay?
I don't like most people. He's in the vast majority.
You know, I was actually starting to think that you were okay.
Yeah? Yeah.
"Yeah, I was thinking, ""Jonathan Byers,"
"maybe he's not the pretentious creep everyone says he is."""
Well, I was just starting to think you were okay.
"Oh. I was thinking, ""Nancy Wheeler,"
she's not just another suburban girl who thinks she's rebelling
by doing exactly what every other suburban girl does...
until that phase passes and they marry some boring onetime jock
who now works sales,
and they live out a perfectly boring little life at the end of a culdesac.
Exactly like their parents, who they thought were so depressing,
"but now, hey, they get it."""
Go away, Lonnie.
Seriously!
I am gonna murd
What? What?
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, no.
"""Oh, no""? What's, ""Oh, no""?"
We're headed back home. What?
Are you sure? Yeah, I'm sure.
Setting sun, right there. We looped right back around.
And you're just realizing this now?
Why is this all on me? Because you're the compass genius!
What do yours say?
North.
Makes no damn sense.
Maybe the gate moved.
No, I don't think it's the gate.
I think it's something else screwing with the compasses.
Maybe it's something here.
No, it has to be like a super magnet.
It's not a magnet.
She's been acting weirder than normal.
If she can slam doors with her mind, she can definitely screw up a compass.
Why would she do that?
Because she's trying to sabotage our mission.
Because she's a traitor!
Lucas, what are you doing?
You did it, didn't you?
You don't want us to reach the gate.
You don't want us to find Will.
Lucas, come on, seriously,
just leave her alone! Admit it.
No. Admit it!
Fresh blood. I knew it. Lucas, come on!
I saw her wiping her nose on the tracks! She was using her powers!
Bull! That's old blood. Right, El?
Right, El?
It's... not...
it's not safe.
Okay.
Should be okay, I mean...
I can't guarantee it, but it should be okay.
What the hell is going on, Hopper?
They bugged my place.
What? They bugged my place.
They put a microphone in the light.
It's because I'm on to them and they know it.
I don't know... Who?
I thought they might be watching you, too.
I don't know, the CIA, the NSA, Department of Energy... I don't know.
You gotta explain this to me, 'cause I am not
I went to the morgue last night, Joyce.
What?
It wasn't him.
What?
Will's body, it was a fake.
You were right.
This whole time, you were right.
What did I tell you? She's been playing us from the beginning!
That's not true. She helped us find Will!
Find Will?
Find Will?
Where is he, then? Huh? I don't see him.
Yeah, you know what I mean. No, I actually don't.
Just think about it, Mike.
She could've just told us where the Upside Down was right away,
but she didn't.
She just made us run around like headless chickens.
All right, calm down! No!
She used us, all of us!
She helped just enough so she could get what she wants.
Food and a bed.
She's like a stray dog. Screw you, Lucas!
No! Screw you, Mike. You're blind...
blind because you like that a girl's not grossed out by you.
But wake up, man! Wake the hell up!
She knows where Will is,
and now she's just letting him die in the Upside Down.
Shut up! For all we know, it's her fault.
Shut up.
We're looking for some stupid monster...
but did you ever stop to think that maybe she's the monster?
I said shut up!
Stop! Knock it off, you idiots.
Stop it! Mike, get off!
Stop it!
Jesus!
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas, are you all right?
Lucas. Lucas, come on!
Lucas, wake up! Lucas. Come on, Lucas!
Why would you do that?
Come on. What's wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
What is that?
I have no idea.
Help! Help!
Come on, wake up. Come on!
Lucas... Lucas, come on!
Lucas.
Lucas, you okay?
Lucas... Lucas, how many fingers am I holding up?
Lucas, how many fingers?
Let me see your head. Get off of me!
Just... Lucas. Lucas, let me see.
Get off of me!
Lucas, come on. Let him go.
Man, let him go.
Where is El?
El?
El! Eleven!
El!
Eleven! El!
Eleven!
What, are you tired?
Shut up.
What?
I heard something.
Oh, God.
It's been hit by a car.
We can't just leave it.
I'll do it.
I thought you said I'm not nine anymore.
What was that?
Where'd it go?
I don't know.
Do you see any more blood?
No.
Jonathan?
Nancy!
Nancy?
Nancy?
Nancy, where are you?
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Come on, come on.
Nancy!
Where are you?
Jonathan! Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Jonathan, I'm right here!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Jonathan, where are you?
Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Jonathan, I'm right... I'm right here!
Where are you?
I'm right here! Jonathan!
I'm right here! Nancy!
Just follow my voice! Jonathan!
Follow my voice, Nancy, I'm right here!
Nancy!
Nancy!
Nancy?
Nancy.
Nancy! Follow my voice!
Nancy?
Jonathan! Nancy!
I got you.
I just don't understand why we're coming out here.
She obviously doesn't wanna talk to you. That's... that's not it.
Oh, really? Because no girl would ever blow off King Steve.
She was acting weird. I mean, something was wrong.
So what? Like, you're worried about her?
What? Aw, you are.
Aw, Steve has a heart. Would you just Stop.
Oh, Stevey's in love. Would you just shut up?
Who knew? Shut up!
Jeez.
Damn. Sorry.
So this is it, huh? Princess' castle.
I'll just be a minute.
Look, we gotta go through this again.
I told you everything that I saw. Oh, gosh. Tell me again.
Upstairs or downstairs? Upstairs.
There was a laboratory.
It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was...
There was this kid's room.
How do you know it was a kid's room? More like a prison.
So why would you think it was a kid's room, then?
Because, I told you,
the size of the bed, there was a drawing, there was a stuffed animal
You didn't say there was a drawing.
Yeah, there was a drawing of a... an adult and a child.
"It said ""Eleven"" on it. Was it good?"
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce. It was stick figures.
Wasn't Will.
Earl...
The night that Benny died,
Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny.
Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe...
Wait... Maybe, it wasn't?
Look... this woman, Terry Ives,
she claims to have lost her daughter, Jane.
She sued Brenner, she sued the government...
Now, the claims came to nothing, but what if...
I mean, what if this whole time I've been...
I've been looking for Will...
I've been chasing after some other kid?
Nancy!
Better?
Yeah.
Is this okay? Uh, I found it in the closet.
I can go home. I just figured
Yeah, no. I...
I don't wanna be alone.
Do you? No. Uh... no.
Can you just come up here?
Yeah.
Do you want the lights off, or On.
Yeah.
You know, it...
it can't get us in here.
We don't know that.
"Uh, yeah, it's Ives. Terry Ives. That's with a ""Y."""
Yeah, I got a pen. Hang on.
Mmmhmm.
Mmmhmm.
Great, thanks. I really appreciate this, Frank.
Say hi to the boys for me, too, would you?
Did you get it?
I got it. Okay.
Oh...
Hey.
Hey.
Couldn't sleep?
Every time I close my eyes, I just...
keep seeing that... thing.
Wherever I was, that place...
I think that it lives there.
It was feeding there.
Feeding on that deer.
That means that if...
if Will and Barbara...
Hey.
My mom said she talked to Will.
If he's alive, there's a chance Barbara is, too.
That means that she's trapped...
in that place.
We have to find it again.
You wanna go back out there?
Maybe we don't have to.
When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer.
Meaning it's... it's a predator, right? Right.
And it seems to hunt at night, like a... a lion or a coyote.
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.
It's always alone, like...
like a bear.
And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself?
And then, last night, the deer... Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
One sec.
Sharks can detect blood in one part per million.
That's one drop of blood in a million,
and they can smell it from a quarter mile away.
So you're saying it can detect blood?
It's just a theory.
We could test it.
But if it works...
At least we'll know it's coming.
Honey, are you up?
Yeah, I'm... I'm getting dressed.
I, uh, made some blueberry pancakes.
I'll be down in a second.
Your mom doesn't knock?
Hi. Scott Clarke? Uh, yes.
The same Scott Clarke who teaches science and AV
at Hawkins Middle? The very same.
Oh, wonderful.
...and we're making a newsletter, which we'll send out monthly.
It'll showcase all the latest equipment,
as well as howto articles, which the kids write themselves.
Oh, that's neat.
What we're really trying to do here, Mr. Clarke
Uh, please, call me Scott.
Scott.
What we're trying to do here, Scott, is to connect kids from all over the state
and give them the support and encouragement
to pursue careers in technology.
We feel these are the kinds of kids that are going to make Indiana proud.
I agree, yes. Completely.
So, you know any kids you think might wanna participate?
Oh, I have a few in mind.
I just... I can't believe she didn't come back.
She's gotta be close. She said it wasn't safe.
She just messed up the compasses because she wanted to protect us.
She didn't betray us. Mike, calm down.
I shouldn't have yelled at her. I never should've done that.
Mike, this isn't your fault. Yeah, it's Lucas'.
It wasn't his fault, either.
It wasn't his fault? No.
So you're saying he wasn't way out of line?
Totally, but so were you! What?
And so was Eleven. Oh, give me a break!
No, Mike, you give me a break!
All three of you were being a bunch of little assholes!
I was the only reasonable one.
But the bottom line is... you pushed first.
And you know the rule. You draw first blood...
No! No way! I'm not shaking his hand.
You're shaking his hand! No, I'm not.
This isn't a discussion. This is the rule of law.
Obey or be banished from the party. Do you wanna be banished?
No. Good.
Where are we going?
Where do you think? We're going to get Lucas.
And then we're gonna find Eleven.
Today is a very special day.
Do you know why?
Because today, we make history.
Today, we make contact.
Here you go.
Ah... yum.
Okay. Now, sweetie, swallow the pancake.
Where is Nancy? I thought she was coming down.
She is.
Uh, she was. I don't know.
Nancy, what's taking so long?
Nancy?
Nancy, come on.
Nan
What do you want?
I drew first blood, so...
Okay, I'll shake.
On one condition.
We forget the weirdo and go straight to the gate.
Then the deal's off. Fine!
Fine! No, no, not fine!
Guys, seriously?
Do you even remember what happened on the Bloodstone Pass?
We couldn't agree on what path to take, so we split up the party
and those trolls took us out one by one.
And it all went to shit. And we were all disabled!
So we stick together, no matter what!
Yeah, I agree. But this is the party, right here in this room.
El is one of us now. Um, no, she's not. Not even close!
Never will be. She's a liar, a traitor
She was just trying to keep us safe!
She didn't mean to hurt you. It was an accident!
An accident?
All right, accident or not...
admit it, it was a little awesome. Awesome?
Yeah, she threw you in the air with her mind!
I could have been killed!
Which is exactly why we need her. She's a weapon!
Do you seriously wanna fight the Demogorgon with your wrist rocket?
That's like R2D2 going to fight Darth Vader.
We're no use to Will if we're dead.
If you two wanna waste your time looking for a traitor, go ahead,
'cause I'm not spending my time on her anymore. No way!
I'm going to the gate. I'm gonna find Will.
It's okay, Eleven.
Don't be frightened. These are all friends.
They're just here to watch.
Don't focus on them.
Stay in here, like before.
Yes, Papa.
Now, remember. Whatever it is, it can't hurt you.
Not from here. So there's nothing to be frightened of.
It's reaching out to you...
'cause it wants you.
Hmm?
It's calling you...
so don't turn away from it this time.
I want you to find it.
Understand?
Yes.
Are you lost?
Is your mom here?
Your dad?
Mouth breather.
What should we do? Uh...
Call the police.
Excuse me. Young lady! You know you have to pay for those!
Hey! Stop right
Please.
You have to pay for those!
Stop right there! Thief! Thief!
Can I help you?
Hi, we're looking for Terry Ives. Does she live here?
Who's asking? The Hawkins chief of police.
And you want to talk to my sister?
Well, if your sister's Terry Ives, then, yeah, we do.
Okay, well, you can come in,
but if you want Terry to tell you anything,
you're about five years too late.
Terry, you have some visitors.
Hello. My name's Joyce Byers.
Uh, this is Hopper. We drove over from Hawkins.
Um, you see, uh, my son...
he's been missing for almost a week now,
and, um, we were wondering if we could talk to you
about your daughter, Jane?
If there's anything that you could tell us about when she was taken...
What was your relationship with Dr. Brenner?
You guys keep in touch?
This is, uh... this is him.
This is Will.
Uh, you may have seen him on... on the news.
Uh... What's wrong with her?
I told you, you're wasting your time.
This is weird without Lucas.
He should've shaken my hand. He's just jealous.
What are you talking about?
Sometimes, your total obliviousness just blows my mind.
He's your best friend, right?
Yeah... I mean, I don't know. It's fine. I get it.
I didn't get here until the fourth grade. He had the advantage of living next door.
But none of that matters.
What matters is that he is your best friend.
And then this girl shows up and starts living in your basement,
and all you ever want to do is pay attention to her.
That's not true. Yes, it is. And you know it.
And he knows it. But no one ever says anything
until you both start punching and yelling at each other
like goblins with intelligence scores of zero.
Now everything's weird. He's not my best friend.
Yeah, right. I mean, he is, but so are you.
And so is Will. Can't have more than one best friend.
Says who? Says logic.
Well, I call bull on your logic, because you're my best friend, too.
Okay.
Whoa.
You don't think...
Uh... definitely.
Are you ready?
She was a part of some study in college.
MK Ultra? Yeah, that's the one.
Was, uh, started in the '50s.
By the time Terry got involved,
it was supposed to be ramping down, but the drugs just got crazier.
Messed her up good.
This was the CIA that ran this?
"You and Terry would've gotten along. ""The Man,"" with a big capital ""M."""
They'd pay... you know,
a couple hundred bucks to people like my sister,
give 'em drugs, psychedelics. LSD, mostly.
And then they'd strip her naked and put her in these isolation tanks.
Isolation tanks? Yeah.
These big bathtubs, basically,
filled with salt water, so you can float around in there.
You lose any sense of, uh...
sense and feel nothing, see nothing.
They wanted to expand the boundaries of the mind.
Real hippie crap.
I... I mean, it's not like they were forcing her to do any of this stuff.
The thing is, though, is that
she didn't know she was pregnant at the time.
Jane.
Do you have any pictures of her?
I don't think you guys understand.
Terry miscarried in the third trimester.
She keeps all of this up. Been doing it for 12 years.
Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real,
like she's gonna come home someday.
"Says she's special. Born with ""abilities."""
Abilities?
You read any Stephen King?
You guys look scared, actually.
I mean, it's all makebelieve.
What... what kind of abilities?
Telepathy, telekinesis...
You know, shit you can do with your mind.
That's why the big, bad Man stole Jane away.
Papa!
Her baby's a weapon, off fighting the commies.
You know, the doctors all say it's a coping mechanism.
You know, to deal with the guilt.
Do you think there is any chance she could be telling the truth?
About having had the kid.
There is no birth certificate, nothing from the hospital.
Doctors and nurses all confirm that she miscarried.
Yeah, but that could've been covered up. Right?
Like I said, you and Terry would've gotten along.
Oh, man.
And I'll have four boxes of the .38s.
What you kids doin' with all this?
Um...
Monster hunting. Huh.
"""Monster hunting""?"
You know, last week...
I was shopping for a new top I thought Steve might like.
It took me and Barb all weekend.
It seemed like life or death, you know? And... and now
You're shopping for bear traps with Jonathan Byers.
Yeah.
What's the weirdest part?
Me or the bear trap?
You. It's definitely you.
Hey, Nance!
Can't wait to see your movie.
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
What?
What?
Hey! Where are you going?
Nancy, wait!
Nancy!
I can't believe it. These kids!
Jesus.
Wow.
Wait!
Tommy, you write like a threeyearold.
Shut up! I didn't know you could spell.
Aw, hey there, princess!
Uhoh! She looks upset.
Oh! Damn!
What is wrong with you?
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you?
I was worried about you.
I can't believe that I was actually worried about you.
What are you talking about? I wouldn't lie if I were you.
You don't want to be known as the lying slut now, do you?
Speak of the devil.
Hi.
You came by last night?
Ding! Ding! Ding! Does she get a prize?
Look, I don't know what you think you saw, but it wasn't like that.
What, you just let him into your room to... study?
Or for another pervy photo session?
We were just You were just what?
Finish that sentence.
Finish the sentence.
Go to hell, Nancy.
Come on, Nancy, let's just leave.
You know what, Byers? I'm actually kind of impressed.
I always took you for a queer, but I guess you're just
a little screwup like your father.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that house is full of screwups.
You know, I guess I shouldn't really be surprised.
A bunch of screwups in your family.
Jonathan, leave it. I mean, your mom...
I'm not even surprised what happened to your brother.
Steve, shut up!
I'm sorry I have to be the one to tell you,
but the Byers, their family, it's a disgrace to the entire
Steve!
Oh!
Steve.
Stop! Steve! Knock it off, you guys!
Get off of him, seriously! Kick his ass, man!
Get off! Stop!
Get in there, he's going to hurt himself! Easy, easy!
Hey. Hey! Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here!
Jonathan, stop! Stop! You're going to hurt him!
Jonathan, stop!
Cops! Guys Jonathan, get off of him!
Stop it! Cops! Come on!
Stop it! Come on! Cops!
You have to stop! Just go, Carol!
Stop it!
Hey, he's had enough, man! I said he's had enough!
Kids! All right! Stop it!
Oh! My nose!
Calm him down!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Hey! Hey, uhuh. Uhuh. Come here, little guys! Come here!
Get off! I got this one!
Get back here! Get back here, you little punks!
Good gift for a college student...
Well, thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
Hmm, yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Good luck. Thank you.
Hey...
What?
We're gonna find him.
Yeah, like Terry found her daughter?
We're close.
Twelve years? Twelve years she's been looking for her
And then she shows up at Benny's five nights ago,
which means we've got a chance.
You know what I would give?
For a chance?
You know what I would give?
Hey, Chief, you there?
Hey, Chief? Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, a fight broke out here and
Cal, I don't have time for this. It's Jonathan Byers.
You haven't seen Joyce, have you?
Do you think we'll be out of here soon?
You, yes. Him, no.
He assaulted a police officer.
Well, how long are you gonna keep him?
You and your boyfriend have big plans, do you?
He's not my boyfriend.
I think you better tell him that.
What?
Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart.
And that damn stupid.
Found some ice.
Thanks.
Everything okay?
Yeah.
Everything's fine.
El!
Eleven!
Eleven! El! El!
Eleven!
Eleven!
Hey, stop. Do you hear that? What?
El!
El?
Hey, there, Frogface.
Toothless.
Shit! Run, Mike!
What? Run! Come on!
You're dead, Wheeler.
Move, Mike!
Mike, come on, run!
Cramp!
Just keep going!
Keep going!
Shit!
Stay back! Don't come any closer!
Nice throw, numbnuts.
Get off! Get off me!
Let him go! Let him go!
Stay back, or I cut him! What do you want?
I want to know how you did it!
How I did what?
I know you did something to me.
Some nerdy science shit to make me do that.
You mean piss your pants?
Our friend has superpowers,
and she squeezed your tiny bladder with her mind.
Shut up!
I think I should save Toothless here a trip to the dentist.
Help him lose the rest of his baby teeth.
Let him go. Let him go!
I'll let him go, sure.
But first... it's your turn.
My turn for what?
Wet yourself.
What? Jump...
or Toothless here gets an early trip to the dentist.
Stop! No!
I'll cut him right now!
All right, just hold on! Hold on!
Mike, don't do it. I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!
Mike, seriously, don't!
Mike, don't do it!
Seriously, don't do it, man! Seriously, don't!
Troy, I don't think this is a good idea, man.
Mike, don't!
Dentist's office opens in five...
Four! Three!
Two! Mike!
One!
Holy shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
She broke my arm! My arm!
Go.
Let's get out of here! Let's go! Go!
Yeah, that's right! You better run!
She's our friend and she's crazy!
You come back here and she'll kill you!
You hear me? She'll kill you, you sons of bitches!
She'll kill you, you hear me?
El, are you okay?
El?
Mike... I'm sorry.
Sorry? What are you sorry for?
The gate...
I opened it.
I'm the monster.
No. No, El, you're not the monster.
You saved me.
Do you understand? You saved me.
I have eyes on 'em now. They're heading home.
That's better.
You don't need it.
Still pretty?
Yeah!
Pretty. Really pretty.
El?
Yes?
Um, I'm happy you're home.
Me, too.
Guys!
It's Lucas, I think he's in trouble.
Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate?
Yeah. What if he found it?
What's he saying?
I don't know, he's way out of range.
...son of a bitch!
Lucas, if you can hear us, slow down. We can't understand you.
Yes, I copy! Do you?
They know about Eleven!
Get out of there! They know about Eleven!
The bad men are coming! All of them!
Do you hear me? The bad men are coming!
"""Mad hen."" Does that mean anything to you?"
Like a code name or something?
"The bad men are coming! ""Bad men."""
Bad men!
Stay here.
What's that guy doing?
You don't think...
Well, I know she and Steve have been spending some time together,
so I thought maybe Mom!
Well, is he home?
Maybe you could ask him? Mom!
I'm sorry, can you just hold on, please?
Michael, I'm on the phone. I've told you a million times
Did you schedule any repairs? What?
Is there anyone supposed to come and do repairs on the house?
I don't understand. Is there something wrong
No, Mom, nothing's wrong in the house. Mike!
One second. Mike!
We need to leave... right now.
Michael!
If anyone asks where I am, I've left the country.
What?
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Dustin!
Dustin, do you copy?
Yeah, Lucas, they're on us.
Where are you? Cornwallis.
Meet me at Elm and Cherry!
Copy. Elm and Cherry!
Okay.
Shit! This way, come on!
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Lucas! Where are they?
I don't know. I think we lost them.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Faster, faster! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
Holy... holy shit!
Did... did you see what she did to that van?
No, Dustin, we missed it.
I mean that was... Awesome.
It was awesome.
Everything I said about you being a traitor and stuff...
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
Friends...
friends don't lie.
I'm sorry, too.
Me, too.
Hey.
Jonathan? Jesus, what... what happened?
Ma'am... I'm fine.
Why is he wearing handcuffs?
Well, your boy assaulted a police officer. That's why.
Take them off. I am afraid I cannot do that.
Take them off! You heard her. Take 'em off.
Chief, I get everyone's emotional here, but there's something you need to see.
What is this?
Why don't you ask your son? We found it in his car.
What? Why are you going through my car?
Is that really the question you should be asking right now?
I wanna see you in my office.
You won't believe me.
Why don't you give me a try?
Mike? Mike?
Yeah, just a minute, please!
Jiminy Christmas.
Hold your horses.
Mr. Wheeler?
Yes?
I don't understand.
You think my son is hiding this girl?
What happened to her hair?
We just need to know if you've seen her in the past week.
No, no. Absolutely not.
Our son with a girl?
I mean, believe me,
if he had a girl sleeping in this house, we'd know about it.
Wouldn't we?
This girl...
what has she done?
I'm afraid I can't answer that.
Oh, my God, is she Russian?
You can't treat us like this. I need you to stay calm.
You come into my house,
and you tell me that my son is hiding some girl,
and that he's in danger, but you can't tell us why?
And you, what, you expect me to remain, what, calm?
I understand how upsetting this is.
I wish we could tell you more...
but I can tell you that your son, Michael, is in real danger.
We want to help him.
We will help him. I give you my word.
But in order for me to do that...
you have to trust me.
Will you trust me?
Good.
Now...
do you have any idea where your son might have gone?
This is Randolph Road, right here.
The fence starts here, and goes all the way around.
And this is the lab right here.
The gate's gotta be in there somewhere.
It's gotta be.
Well, who owns Hawkins Lab?
"The sign says ""Department of Energy."""
Department of Energy? What do you think that means?
It means government. Military.
"Then why does it say ""Energy""? Just trust me, all right?"
It's military. My dad's told me before.
Mike's right. There's soldiers out front.
Do they make, like, lightbulbs or something?
No, weapons...
to fight the Russians, and commies and stuff.
Weapons.
Oh, Jesus, this is bad.
Really bad. The place is like a fortress.
Well, what do we do?
I don't know, but we can't go home.
We're fugitives now.
Guys?
Do you hear that?
Go, go, go, go! Come on, come on!
It's stuck. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Hurry up! Hurry, come on! Come on!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Get down!
Mental.
You say blood draws this thing?
We don't know.
It's just a theory.
I'm sorry, Mom.
What, you're sorry? You're... you're sorry?
That is not good enough, Jonathan. I know.
That's not even close. That's not even in the... in the ballpark.
I wanted to tell you, I just
What if this thing took you, too?
You risked your life... and Nancy's.
I thought I could save Will... I still do.
This is not yours to fix alone.
You act like you're all alone out there in the world, but you're not.
You're not alone.
I know.
God damn it, Jonathan.
I know. Damn it.
I want an apology!
An apology for what, exactly?
Where is the chief? I want to speak to him
right this instant. Stay here.
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
What is your name, Deputy?
Well, I'm an officer... okay?
Name and badge number, both of you!
What the hell is going on here? Chief...
These men are humiliating my son.
No, no, no. Okay, that's not true. Yes.
There was some kind of fight, Chief
A psychotic child broke his arm!
A little girl, Chief. A little one. That tone! Do you hear that tone?
Honestly, I'm just trying to state a fact.
I don't have time for this. It was a little girl
Will you please take a statement... and get her out?
Yes. So what'd this girl look like?
She had no hair and she was bleeding from her nose.
Like a freak.
What'd you just say?
I said she's a freak!
No, her hair. What'd you say about her hair?
Her head's shaved.
She doesn't even look like a girl.
And...
And what?
Tell the man, Troy.
She can...
do things.
What kind of things?
Like...
make you fly.
And piss yourself.
What?
Was she alone?
She always hangs out with those losers.
"""Losers""?"
What losers?
Hey.
You owe me $1.20.
Don't worry, he'll need more than aspirin when we're done with him.
Yeah, if the creep ever gets out.
The cops should just lock him up forever.
Did you see the look on his face?
Oh.
He probably had that same look whenever he killed his brother, right?
Oh, God, I just got an image of him making that face
while he and Nancy are screwing.
Carol, for once in your life, shut your damn mouth!
What? Hey, what's your problem, man?
You're both assholes. That's my problem.
Are you serious right now, man? Yeah, I'm serious.
You shouldn't have done that.
Done what? You know what.
You mean call her out for what she really is?
Oh, that's funny, because I don't remember you asking me to stop.
I should've put that spray paint right down your throat.
What the hell, Steve? You know,
neither of you ever cared about her. You never even liked her,
because she's not miserable like you two.
She actually cares about other people.
The slut with a heart of gold.
I told you to watch your mouth!
Hey! I don't know what's gotten into you, man,
but you don't talk to her that way. Get out of my face.
Or what?
Or what?
You gonna fight me now, too? Huh?
You gonna fight me now, too?
Because you couldn't take Jonathan Byers...
so I wouldn't recommend that.
Here, let me get the door for you, buddy.
That's right. Run away, Stevie boy!
Run away! Just like you always do.
That Nancy's turning you into a little pussy!
That's right, Harrington, run away!
Run away!
I have to go home.
No, you can't.
My mom... my dad are there. They're gonna be okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Let go.
Let go! Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.
The last thing in the world we need
is them knowing you're mixed up in all this.
Mike is over there They haven't found him.
Not yet, at least.
For Mike? Come on, get in the car.
Look, we need to find them before they do.
Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
No, I don't. I need you to think.
I don't know. We haven't talked a lot.
I mean, lately...
Is there any place that your...
your parents don't know about that he might go?
I don't know. I might.
What?
I don't know where he is, but I think I know how to ask him.
Whoa.
I got it.
Mike, are you there? Mike?
You guys hear that?
Mike, it's me, Nancy.
Mike, are you there?
Answer.
Mike, we need you to answer.
Is that your sister?
This is an emergency, Mike.
Do you copy?
Mike, do you copy?
Okay, this is really weird.
Don't answer.
She said it was an emergency. What if it's a trick?
It's your sister! What if the bad people kidnapped her?
What if they're forcing her to say this? I need you to answer.
It's like Lando Calrissian. Don't answer.
We need to know that you're there, Mike.
Listen, kid, this is the chief. If you're there, pick up.
We know you're in trouble and we know about the girl.
Why is she with the chief?
How the hell does he know about...
We can protect you, we can help you, but you gotta pick up.
Are you there? Do you copy? Over.
Anybody got any other ideas?
Yeah, I copy.
It's Mike.
I'm here.
We're here.
Need a hand?
Did you have something to do with this?
I just...
I wanna help.
All yours.
They expect us to just sit here like prisoners.
We should be out there looking for him.
Honey, we have to trust them, okay?
This is our government. They're on our side.
That man gives me the creeps.
Nancy.
You don't think she's involved in this, too, do you?
Nancy with Mike?
No.
No.
Will you stop pacing?
It's been way too long.
Do you know what? Maybe you're right. Maybe this is all a trap
and the bad men are coming to get us right now!
It's not a trap.
Why would the chief set us up?
Nancy, maybe, but the chief?
Lando Calrissian.
Would you shut up about Lando?
I don't feel good about this. I don't feel good about this!
When do you feel good about anything?
Shit!
Go, go, go, go.
Lando.
You think they saw us?
Both of you, shut up.
Hey!
What the
All right, let's go.
Let's go!
Mike. Oh, my God. Mike!
I was so worried about you.
Yeah, uh... me, too.
Is that my dress?
Okay, so, in this example, we're the acrobat.
Will and Barbara, and that monster, they're this flea.
And this is the Upside Down, where Will is hiding.
Mr. Clarke said the only way to get there is through a rip of time and space.
A gate. That we tracked to Hawkins Lab.
With our compasses.
Okay, so the gate has a really strong electromagnetic field,
and that can change the directions of a compass needle.
Is this gate underground?
Yes.
Near a large water tank?
Yes.
How do you know all that?
He's seen it.
Is there any way that you could...
that you could reach Will? That you could talk to him in this
The Upside Down.
Down. Yeah.
And my friend Barbara?
Can you find her, too?
I'm sorry.
What?
What's wrong? What happened?
I can't find them.
Whenever she uses her powers, she gets weak.
The more energy she uses, the more tired she gets.
Like, she flipped the van earlier. It was awesome.
But she's drained. Like a bad battery.
Well... How do we make her better?
We don't. We just have to wait and try again.
Well, how long?
I don't know.
The bath.
What?
I can find them.
In the bath.
Oh!
Oh. Oh, my... No, mmmmmm.
Hey, you know how they did that? You know what that is?
No, what?
Melted plastic and microwaved bubble gum.
No way. Really?
Really.
What in the world? Do you want me to pause it?
I'm sure it's just a wrong number.
Hello?
Mr. Clarke? It's Dustin.
Dustin? Is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah. I just, I...
I have a science question.
It's ten o'clock on Saturday. Why don't we pick this up
Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks?
Specifically how to build one?
Sensory deprivation? What is this for?
Fun.
Okay. Well...
Why don't we talk about it Monday? After school, okay?
You always say we should never stop being curious.
To always open any curiosity door we find.
Dustin
Why are you keeping this curiosity door locked?
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh. How much?
Uhhuh.
Yep, all right. Yeah, we'll be careful.
Definitely. All right, Mr. Clarke.
Yeah, I'll see you on Monday. I'll see you on Monday, Mr. Clarke.
Bye.
Do you still have that kiddie pool we bobbed for apples in?
I think so. Yeah. Yeah.
Good. Then we just need salt. Lots of it.
"How much is ""lots""?"
1,500 pounds.
Well, where are we gonna get that much salt?
Hey, wait.
It's not gonna snow next week, is it?
Worst case, no school.
Even if we find Will in there...
what are we gonna do about that thing?
We're not gonna do anything.
I don't want you anywhere near this, all right?
Your mom's been through enough already. He's my brother.
Listen to me. I'm gonna find him. All right?
You gotta trust me on this.
I am going to find him.
This damn thing is heavy.
Come on. It's upside down.
No, this way.
Okay, um... How does this even work?
Try that side. Son of a bitch!
Pull it back. Pull it back. I am!
One, two, three.
Shit!
Ah.
Stand back.
Whoa.
What did she even eat?
What? Eleven.
Oh. Candy, leftovers, Eggos...
She really likes Eggos.
I knew you were acting weird. I just...
I thought it was because of Will.
I knew you were acting weird, too. I thought it was 'cause of Steve.
Hey...
No more secrets, okay?
From now on we tell each other everything.
Okay. Do you like Jonathan now?
What? No.
No, it's... it's not... it's not like that.
Do you like Eleven?
What? No. Ew. Gross.
This will keep it dark for you.
Just like in your bathtub.
You're a very brave girl.
You know that, don't you?
Everything you're doing for my boy... for Will...
for my family...
Thank you.
Listen.
I am gonna be there with you the whole time.
And if it ever gets too scary...
in that place, you just let me know, okay?
Yes.
Ready?
Ready.
Colder!
Warmer!
Right there!
Barb?
Barbara?
What's going on? I don't know.
Is Barb okay? Is she okay?
Gone! Gone!
Gone!
Gone! Gone!
Gone. Gone.
Gone.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Gone. Gone! It's okay. It's okay.
Gone!
Hey. It's okay.
It's okay, we're right here. We're right here, honey.
It's okay. I got you.
Don't be afraid.
I'm right here with you.
I'm right here with you.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay, you're safe.
You're okay, honey.
Castle Byers.
Castle Byers.
Will.
Will?
You tell him... tell him I'm coming.
Mom is coming.
Your mom... she's coming for you.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Okay. Listen, you tell him to... to stay where he is.
We're coming. We're coming, okay? We're coming, honey.
Just... just hold on a little longer.
Will. Will.
Will?
Will!
Oh!
Oh, okay, okay.
I've got you.
It's okay. I got you. I got you.
I got you, honey. You did so good.
Are you okay?
So this fort. Where is it?
Uh, it's in the woods behind our house.
Yeah, he used to go there to hide.
Hey, get back inside.
What, are you insane?
No, I'm Look, if something happens to me,
I don't make it back
Yeah, but then I'll go. You stay.
Are you kidding me?
He's my son, Hop. My son.
I'm going!
Now, listen, I need you to stay here... No.
...and watch over the kids. No, Mom.
I can help. Please, I need you to stay, Jonathan.
Joyce!
Please. Please, be careful.
Joyce, come on! Please. I'm gonna find him.
I'm gonna find him.
We have to go back to the station.
What?
Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.
That thing is still in there.
And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.
We can't.
You still wanna try it out?
I wanna finish what we started.
I want to kill it.
So this is your plan?
Worked for me before, didn't it?
Well, did it? Come on, trust me.
I'd like to hear your thoughts on the war.
I think we're dealing with a whole different environment here.
I'll tell you what, we always planned
on the Russians massing the fire and we...
Don't move!
All right, move in.
It's all right.
Let me do the talking.
♪ If I go there will be trouble ♪
♪ And if I stay it will be double ♪
♪ So, come on and let me know ♪
♪ Should I stay or should I go now? ♪
Let me out of here!
Somebody, please!
Let me out!
Your son.
We know you've been in contact with him.
You have to let me When...
and how did you make contact with him?
What? Hmm?
Six.
What?
Six.
Six people have been taken this week.
This... thing that took your son...
we don't really understand it.
But its behavior is predictable.
Like all animals...
it eats.
It will take more sons.
More daughters.
I want to save them.
I want to save your son.
But I can't do that.
Not without your help.
Stop.
I know who you are.
I know what you've done.
You took my boy away from me!
You left him in that place to die!
You faked his death!
We had a funeral.
We buried him.
And now you're asking for my help?
Go to hell.
Okay, now what do you know?
I'm sorry.
Did I stutter?
I told you.
Everything.
What do you know?
I know you do experiments on kidnapped little kids,
whose parents' brains you've turned to mush.
And I know you went a little too far this time
and you messed up in a big way.
I mean, you really messed up, didn't you? Big time.
That's why you're trying to cover your tracks.
You killed Benny Hammond, you faked Will Byers' death.
You made it look like that little girl just ran away.
See, I told you.
I know everything. All right, who are you working with?
Nobody.
But I did give all this over to my friend at the Times.
He's gonna blow this thing wide open.
You're just a junkie.
A small town cop who had a really bad week.
Took one too many pills this time.
You made a mistake coming back here.
No, I didn't.
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna let me and Joyce Byers go...
you're gonna give us anything we need,
and we're gonna find her son.
And then we're gonna forget that any of this ever happened.
Oh, is that right?
Yeah.
That's right.
Nancy? Jonathan?
They're gone. What?
Nancy and Jonathan. His car's gone.
They're probably just sucking face somewhere.
Gross. No. No way!
Did they go with the chief?
I don't know.
No.
What? Did you see them? Do you know where they went?
Yes. Where? Where did they go?
Demogorgon.
Where's the girl?
You gotta give me your word.
Nobody's ever gonna find out about this.
And those other three kids, those boys, you're gonna leave them alone.
Then I'll tell you.
Tell you where your little science experiment is.
I don't understand.
We came to an agreement.
What?
Look, everything that's happened here and everything that's gonna happen,
we don't talk about.
You want Will back?
This place had nothing to do with it.
That's the deal. You got it?
What is this?
Protection. The atmosphere is toxic.
But my son's in there. He...
Put it on.
I'm telling you, this is a mistake.
It's gone. Isn't that what you wanted?
And if they find the boy?
That's not gonna happen.
Hey, you all right?
Yeah.
I need you to relax, okay?
I want you to slow down your breathing, take deep breaths.
In and out.
Deep breath in...
and out.
In and out.
In and out. It's troll's favorite food!
Princess! No, Daddy! No, Daddy!
Roasted princess with paprika and gravy! No! No, Daddy. No, Daddy.
Whoa, hey!
Hey.
You all right?
What's going on? Whoa.
What happened? What happened? I don't know. I don't know.
Hey, you all right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Relax, relax. Honey, honey.
Honey, just breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
In and out. Slow, slow, slow.
In and out with me.
In...
You okay? Yeah.
Yeah.
Remember...
Straight into Will's room. And Don't step on the trap.
Wait for the yoyo to move.
Then...
All right.
You ready?
Ready.
On three.
One...
two...
You don't have to do this
Jonathan, stop talking.
I'm just saying, you don't have to Three.
Guys, guys! This is crazy.
We can't just wait around.
Mike, in case you forgot, we're still fugitives.
The bad men are still looking for us.
Yeah, and we don't even know where your sister is.
El can find them.
Mike, look at her.
I still think we should stick to the chief's plan.
Exactly. We stay here, keep El out of sight and keep her safe.
That's the most important thing, remember?
Besides, she's okay. She's with Jonathan.
Yeah, and she's kind of a badass now, so...
Well, where are you going? You just said stick to the plan!
I am. I'm just gonna go get some chocolate pudding.
I'm telling you, Lunch Lady Phyllis hoards that shit.
Are you serious?
El needs to be recharged!
Did you hear that?
It's just the wind.
Don't worry.
My mom, she said the lights speak when it comes.
Speak?
Blink.
Think of them as alarms.
Is that too tight?
No, it's fine.
Thanks.
Nancy?
Yeah?
Jonathan?
Are you there, man? It's... it's Steve!
Listen, I just want to talk!
Steve, listen to me. Hey. Nancy, what
You need to leave. I'm not trying to start anything, okay?
I don't care about that. You need to leave.
No, no, no. Listen, I messed up, okay?
I messed... I messed up.
Okay?
Really. Please.
I just want to make things right.
Okay? Please. Please...
Hey, what happened to your hand?
Is that blood?
Nothing. It was an accident.
Yeah, what's going on? Nothing.
Wait a sec. Did he do this to you? No.
Nancy, let me in! No. No! No, Steve!
What is... What the... You need to get out of here.
Whoa. What is all Listen to me. I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you, get out of here! What is that smell?
Is that... is that gasoline? Steve, get out!
Wait. What? What is going on?
You have five seconds to get out of here.
Okay, is this a joke? Stop. Put the gun down.
I'm doing this for you. Nancy.
Wait. Is this a... What is this? Nancy.
Three. Two. No, no, no! No, no!
Nancy! The lights.
It's here. Wait, what's here?
Where is it? Where is what? Whoa!
Easy with that! Where is it?
I don't know. I don't see it.
Where is what?
Hello? Will someone please explain to me what the hell is going
No!
Go! Go! Run! Go!
Get out of here!
Jump! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Jesus! Jesus! What the hell was that?
What the hell was that? Shut up!
What's it doing?
I don't know.
Do you hear anything?
No.
Will!
Will!
Will!
Will!
"""I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she didn't know"
and for pity's sake not to ask her any more questions.
She said I must have asked her a thousand already.
I suppose I had, too,
but how are you gonna find things out if you don't ask questions?
And what does make roads red?
'Well, I don't know,' said Matthew.
It just makes me feel glad to be alive...
"it's such an interesting world."""
Will!
Will!
This is crazy. This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy! This is crazy! This is crazy!
What are you do What are you doing? Are you insane?
It's going to come back!
So you need to leave.
Right now.
Where is it?
Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch.
You see it? No. Where
Come on.
Where are you? Come on!
Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Jonathan!
Go to hell, you son of a bitch!
Steve!
He's in the trap!
He's stuck! Jonathan, now!
Did you hear that?
Get back!
Where did it go? No.
It has to be dead.
It has to be.
Come on.
Is that my house?
It was hurt.
Mom.
Is that you?
Mom.
Jonathan?
Joyce, come on.
Where's it going?
I don't think that's the monster.
Found it! I knew she was hoarding it.
I knew it. Yeah.
Always lying, saying she's out.
Baldfaced liar.
Mike, I found the chocolate pudding!
Okay!
Are you feeling any better?
"What's ""putting""?"
Pudding, it's...
it's this chocolate goo you eat with a spoon.
Don't worry,
when all this is over, you won't have to keep eating junk food
and leftovers like a dog anymore.
My mom, she's a pretty awesome cook.
She can make you whatever you like.
Eggos?
Well, yeah, Eggos, but real food, too.
See, I was thinking,
once all this is over and Will's back and you're not a secret anymore,
my parents can get you an actual bed for the basement.
Or you can take my room if you want,
since I'm down there all the time anyways.
My point is, they'll take care of you.
They'll be like your new parents,
and Nancy, she'll be like your new sister.
Will you be like my brother?
What? No, no.
"Why ""no""?"
Because...
'cause it's different.
Why?
I mean, I don't know, I guess it's not.
It's stupid.
Mike?
Yeah?
Friends don't lie.
Well...
I was thinking...
I don't know...
maybe we can go to the Snow Ball together.
"""Snow Ball""? It's this cheesy school dance,"
where you go in the gym and dance to music and stuff.
I've never been, but I know you're not supposed to go with your sister.
No? I mean...
you can, but it'd be really weird.
You go to school dances with someone that, you know...
someone that you like.
A friend? Not a friend.
Uh... uh...
Uh, someone like a...
Nancy. Hold on, I'll be right back.
Stay here.
Go!
You two, on me.
This will charge your battery right up, I'm telling you.
Guys! Guys! What is it?
They found us.
We know they're here.
Be advised, west side of the building is clear.
Sir, we've searched everywhere. There's no sign of them.
Nothin'.
Keep it locked down.
All right.
Kitchen.
How did they find us?
I don't know, but they knew we were in the gym.
Lando.
Got 'em! Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!
There they are. Freeze. Back! Go back!
Go, go! Go left!
El, are you okay?
El!
Something's wrong. She's just drained.
No, no, no, she won't wake up. El!
El! El!
There's more blood.
Oh, my God.
This way.
She's barely breathing. We gotta go.
Leave her.
Step away from the child. No!
You want her, you have to kill us first.
That's right! Eat shit!
Oh, no! No, no! No! No! Get off me!
You idiot! No!
Get off me! Ow! Let go!
Eleven? Eleven, can you hear me?
Eleven?
Papa?
Yes, yes, it's your papa.
Get off of me. I'm here now.
Let her go! Let her go, you bastard!
Shh, shh, you're sick.
You're sick, but I'm going to make you better.
I'm going to take you back home, where I can make you well again.
Where we can make all of this better,
so no one else gets hurt.
Bad.
Bad.
Mike. Mike.
Mike.
Blood.
What?
Blood.
Demogorgon.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on. Go, go!
Oh, my God.
Will! Will!
Will! Oh, my God!
Will! Hopper!
Oh, my God! You need to help get him out!
Get him out!
Oh, Jesus.
Come on, come on!
Oh, my God!
Sorry. Hold on, we're almost there. We're almost there.
Come on. Come on.
Help, help.
Come on, get her on the table.
Just hold on a little longer, okay?
He's gone. The bad man's gone.
We'll be home soon, and my mom...
she'll get you your own bed.
You can eat as many Eggos as you want.
And we can go to the Snow Ball.
Promise?
Promise.
Is... Is it dead?
Go, go, go, go!
Get the wrist rocket! Get the wrist rocket now!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go. Take it out now!
Get the rocks, get the rocks, get the rocks!
Getting the rocks!
Give me one. Come on!
Go! Go! Kill it! Kill it! Fire! Fire!
Give me another one. Kill it! Bastard!
Kill it! Go, go, go, go! Kill it now!
Get, get, get... Come on, kill the bastard!
It's not working!
Hit him again. Kill him!
Keep going! Come on! Get, get, get...
Come on, kill it! Come on! Go, go, go!
Eleven, stop!
Goodbye, Mike.
No more.
El? El?
El! Eleven!
Eleven! El!
El, where are you?
Eleven!
El?
Oh, God.
He's not breathing, he's not breathing.
All right, Joyce, Joyce, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.
I need you to tilt his head back... Okay.
...and lift his chin. Okay.
One, two, three, four.
Now when I tell you,
you're gonna pinch his nostrils, and breathe into his mouth...
twice. Okay.
One second...
then pause.
Then one second. Okay.
Now! Go!
Oh, come on, come on. Come on...
Come on, kid.
Come on, kid! Will!
Will, listen to me.
It's me, it's your mom and I love you so much.
I love you so much.
I love you more than anything in the world.
Please...
Blood pressure keeps dropping.
Her pulse ox is falling.
I love you so much. I love you more than anything in the world.
Please, please come back to me. Just...
Come on, kid! Please, please wake up.
Please, please.
Breathe, Will, come on!
Flatlining!
Come back to me, breathe.
I need you to wake up now.
I need you to breathe.
Please breathe!
Please!
That's it.
Oh, my God, that's it, that's it.
That's it, baby. Breathe.
Breathe. All right. Come on.
Come on.
Breathe, breathe, come on, come on.
Good, good, good, good.
Just breathe, Will, breathe.
Michael?
Michael!
Michael?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Hey.
Hi, sweetheart. Hey.
Where... where am I?
You're home. You're home now.
You're safe.
Jonathan.
Yeah, it's me, buddy.
We missed you.
We really missed you.
Are you okay?
What, this?
It's just a cut. It's nothing.
You're worried about my hand.
Oh, hey, uh...
We, uh...
We brought you some stuff...
so you don't get bored in here.
So...
Uh, I made you a new mix tape.
There's some stuff on there I think you really might like.
Guys. Guys, he's up. Will is up. Guys, Will's up.
Guys, come on.
Byers!
Be careful. Be careful with him.
Move. Guys, guys.
Go easy on him.
You won't believe what happened when you were gone, man.
It was mental. You had a funeral.
Jennifer Hayes was crying. And Troy peed himself.
What? In front of the whole school!
Yes!
You okay?
It got me.
The Demogorgon.
We know.
It's okay.
It's dead.
We made a new friend.
She stopped it. She saved us.
But she's gone now.
Her name's Eleven. Like the number?
"Well, we call her ""El"" for short."
She's basically a wizard.
She has superpowers.
More like a Yoda.
She flipped a van with her mind,
and these agents were trying to shoot us
Yeah, it flipped over us Then she squeezed the brains out...
And blood was pouring out of their faces.
It was pouring out of their eyes.
Agents just started grabbing us and stuff...
...shot out of the wall...
Something is coming. Something angry.
Hungry for your blood.
It is almost here.
What is it? It's the thessalhydra, I'm telling you.
It's not the thessalhydra.
I'm telling you, it's the thessalhydra.
The thessalhydra!
Damn it. It roars in anger!
Will, your action! What should I do? I
Fireball him!
Fireball the son of a bitch.
Fourteen!
Direct hit. Will the Wise's fireball hits the thessalhydra.
It makes a painful...
and then... it crumbles to the ground.
Its clawed hand reaches for you one last time
and, and, and...
and...
Lucas cuts off its seven heads,
and Dustin places them into his bag of holding.
You carry the heads out of the dungeon, victorious,
and you present them to King Tristan.
He thanks you for your bravery and service.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, that's not it, is it?
No, there's a medal ceremony
Oh, a medal ceremony? What are you talking about?
And The campaign was way too short.
Yeah! It was ten hours!
But it doesn't make any sense.
It makes sense. Uh, no, what about the lost knight?
And the proud princess?
And those weird flowers in the cave?
I don't know, it's
Jeez, what's that smell?
Have you guys been playing games all day, or just farting?
Oh, that's just Dustin.
He farted.
Dustin farted. Okay.
Dustin farted. Very mature, Lucas.
Oh.
Will. Shut up.
Come on. Dustin farted!
Bye, guys. Bye, Will.
See you, Will.
Stop. No, you stop.
No, you stop.
Yeah, scream! You're like a little girl.
So, you have fun? Yeah.
Hey, boys.
Hey, Mrs. Wheeler. Hi.
Hey, wish your mom a merry Christmas for me, okay?
Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Uh, merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
So, uh, you win? Yeah.
Awesome. Hey, Jonathan, wait up.
Uh... Merry Christmas.
Thanks, um...
I... I didn't get you anything.
I... I feel bad. No.
No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.
It's, um... Well, you'll see.
Merry Christmas.
You ready? Let's go. Yeah.
All right. Buckle up.
Can I open it?
Yeah, sure.
Whoa.
Pretty cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, pretty cool.
Did you give it to him?
Yeah.
You leaving already, Chief?
Oh, come on, you think I actually wanted to come to this thing? I was just hungry.
Oh, yeah, that's the spirit.
Well, your wife doesn't have time to cook for me, you know what I'm saying?
Merry Christmas, Hop.
Mmm.
What you got there?
That one of yours?
Yeah. Looks pretty big.
Be careful. You'll break it.
What are you... What are you doing?
Documenting.
Oh, why?
Because...
It looks great. Oh, this is just so overcooked.
And look, the potatoes are runny. Mom.
They're so runny. Mom, it's gonna be great.
It's definitely an Atari. An awhati?
The green present. It's an Atari.
I felt Dustin's today, it's the same exact weight.
Really? Well... Yeah.
We'll have to see, won't we?
Hey, no more snooping.
No, I forgot to wash my hands. I'll be right back.
Okay.
He's washing his hands?
Thanks.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Mmm. Very good, Mom.
Mmm. Hey, Mom. Did Will tell you about, uh, the game?
Oh, yeah. No. What game?
I threw a fireball at him and... dead.
Wait, what is... You mean, this is...
No, it's just Dungeons & Dragons.
Dungeons & Dragons. Right. It's fun.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Move it. Let's get out of here!
Headed down Poplar, toward Main.
Get 'em off of us, Mick! I'm working on it!
The alley. To your right. Okay.
Shit!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Shit!
Okay. Okay.
Son of a bitch! We got more! Oh, shit!
They're headed down 7th.
Do something, Kali. Do something!
Next right. There's a tunnel. Take it.
We got these bastards now!
Boom.
Holy shit!
Shit! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
What the hell is wrong with you, Adams? The hell are you doing?
Adams! Come on. What the hell? Why'd you stop?
Adams! Adams!
Adams, I'm talkin' to you!
Adams! Adams!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
A police chase rocked downtown Pittsburgh earlier this evening...
Another stupid penny! Dusty, watch it! You almost hit Mews.
Can I please check under your cushions? Dusty.
Mom, please? It's an emergency!
Who's your buddy? Who's your buddy?
Love you, Mom.
Lucas, you copy? I've got four quarters. What's your haul?
Take your puny haul and multiply it by five.
How? While you were scrounging around
like a homeless bum, I mowed Old Man Humphrey's lawn.
Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash?
Just call Mike already. You call Mike.
I have to go take a shower from doing real work, like a man.
Over and out.
Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy?
Yeah. Yeah, I copy.
What are you doing on this channel? Nothing.
Lucas and I have six bucks total.
What's your haul? Shit! I don't know yet.
What do you mean you don't know yet? Hold on. Call Will.
What the hell are you doing?
I'll pay you back!
Bye! Mike!
Mike! Get back here! Hey. No running in the house.
What is going on?
Mike! Mike!
Asshole!
Hey! Okay. So, I'll pick you up in two hours.
That's 9:00 on the dot, okay? Okay.
If anything happens, if you need to come home,
just ask them to use their phone and call home. Okay?
Don't Don't walk or bike home. I know.
Okay, but, sweetie Mom, I have to go.
Have fun.
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.
Oh, Jesus! I'm in unchartered territory here, guys.
Down! Down! Down! I'm going! I'm going!
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!
Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
No. No. No!
No! No! No! I hate this overpriced bullshit!
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!
You're not nimble enough. But you'll get there one day.
But until then, Princess Daphne is still mine.
Whatever. I'm still tops on Centipede and Dig Dug.
You sure about that?
Sure about what?
You're kidding me. No, no, no.
Move! Move! No, no, no, no, no. Hey, no! No! No!
751,300 points! That's impossible.
Who is Mad Max? Better than you.
Is it you? You know I despise Dig Dug.
Then who is it? Yeah, spill it, Keith.
You want information, then I need something in return.
No, no, no. No way. You're not getting a date with her.
Mike, come on. Just get him the date.
I'm not prostituting my sister!
But it's for a good cause. No, don't get him the date. Know what?
He's gonna spread his nastyass rash to your whole family.
Acne isn't a rash and it isn't contagious, you prepubescent wastoid.
Oh, I'm a wastoid? She wouldn't go on a date with you.
You make, like, what? $2.50 an hour?
Nice perm. Gonna make fun of my hair?
Hey. Hey, guys, do you see the...
Will! Are you okay?
Yeah. I just...
I needed some air. Come on. You're up on Dig Dug.
Let's take that top score back, huh?
Good morning, Jim.
Jim. Hold on a second. We need to talk. Get away from me.
Okay, no... I think you really wanna hear this.
Get away from me. Trust me. I only want five minutes!
Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things.
This isn't a laughing matter, Jim.
This is serious, okay?
I really got something here. I'm telling you!
Hey. Mornin', Chief. Morning.
Morning, Murray.
Got any proof on your buttprobin' aliens yet, Murray?
I believe there was, and may still be,
a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.
Russian spies!
Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens? Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused.
I'm talking multiple reports now. Multiple reports, okay?
Of a Russian child in Hawkins.
A child? What are you talking about? A girl who may have psionic abilities.
"""Psionic""? Psychic."
What about that girl that made that kid pee himself?
A prank. What girl?
Wasn't a prank.
You got five minutes. Not a second more.
I talked to a Big Buy exemployee
who said some little girl shattered the door with her mind.
I heard that story.
Did you hear the one about the fat man with the beard who climbs down chimneys?
Then last month, a coworker of Ted Wheeler's claims
some Russian girl with a shaved head was hiding in his basement.
Ted now denies this.
Oh, wow. That's a surprise. But it connects.
Enlighten me. This girl,
she's some kind of a Russian weapon, right?
Barbara sees this girl, tries to help her, perhaps.
But before she can, the Russians find them, take them
Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland was kidnapped by Russian spies.
Kidnapped. Killed. Killed?
Don't you get it, Jim? No.
This has potentially international implications.
I'm talking a fullon Russian invasion right here in Hawkins.
Do you have any proof of this girl? I mean, has anybody seen her recently?
These are separate
Excuse me. Sorry.
Okay. Hello?
Merrill called, wants you to check out his pumpkins.
Says they've been contaminated... All right.
...by his vengeful neighbor, Eugene. You're welcome.
I'm sorry. I really hate to do this, but I gotta run.
It's an emergency. You gave me five minutes.
Yeah, listen, you know what? I liked your alien theory a lot better.
And you want my advice?
Why don't you stop bleeding those people dry and go home? All right?
I am not bleeding anyone... dry. Listen to me. Go home.
It's crap, I know.
No, it's not crap.
It's not good. It's going to be.
Just... It needs some reorganizing.
Can I mark on it? Yeah, I guess.
So, in the first paragraph,
you used the basketball game versus Northern
as a metaphor for your life, which is great.
But then, around here,
you start talking about your granddad's experiences in the war.
And I... I don't see how they're connected.
It connects because...
because, you know, we both won.
Do you think I should start from scratch? No. I mean...
When's the deadline?
It's tomorrow for early application.
Can you come and help me tonight?
We have our dinner tonight, remember?
Oh, my God! We already canceled last week.
You don't have to go. Just work on this. No, no, no. What's the point?
Hey, calm down. I'm calm. I'm calm.
I'm just being honest. You know, I mean...
I'll end up working for my dad anyway. That's not true.
I don't know, Nance. Is that such a bad thing?
There's insurance and benefits and all that adult stuff.
And if I took it, you know, I could be around for your senior year.
Steve... Just to look after you a little bit.
Make sure you don't forget about this pretty face.
Nance, I'm serious.
I love you. I love you, too.
Who is that?
I have no idea.
But would you check out that ass?
Just look at it go.
Meet the human brain.
I know. I know, it doesn't look like much.
A little gross even, right? But consider this.
There are a hundred billion cells inside of this miracle of evolution.
All working as one.
No, no, I did not misspeak. I did not stutter.
A hundred billion.
Ah, this must be our new student.
Indeed. All yours.
All right. Hold up. You don't get away that easy.
Come on up. Don't be shy.
Dustin, drum roll.
Class, please welcome, all the way from sunny California,
the latest passenger to join us on our curiosity voyage, Maxine.
It's Max. Sorry?
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.
Mad Max. Well, all aboard, Max.
Hey, there. Hey.
Do you have these in any other colors? I'm not a big fan of orange.
Hmm...
I'll have to check in back.
Oh, shit!
You're gonna get me fired. That's my master plan.
Get you fired so I can hire you and we won't have to hide back here.
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.
I know. I'm sorry. I can't stop thinking about you.
It's crazy. I feel like a teenager. Me, too.
You know, in high school, you didn't know who I was.
Come on.
Bob, I have to get back to work.
Okay.
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies, and I'll see you tonight for movie night.
Jonathan's night to pick?
Yes. Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Hey, look, a green one.
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary. I hate scary movies.
You're saying this was fine yesterday?
Fine?
These were prize winners, Chief. You should've seen 'em.
For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what happened.
And then I remembered... Eugene.
What about him?
He's been complaining about me to just about anyone who'll listen.
Why's that?
"Well, he started this ""Pick Your Pumpkin"" thing."
Acted like it was trademarked.
"I said, ""Hire yourself a damn lawyer. See how far that gets you."""
You're telling me that nice old Eugene
came out here after dark and doused your field with poison?
Not Eugene himself.
I'm thinking one of his field hands. Uhhuh.
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around accusations lightly. You know me.
This happening the day before Halloween, when sales are peaking?
That's a hell of a coincidence.
Hell of a coincidence.
You got somebody working on that field?
Yeah, screw you, too.
Hey. Be there.
Hey, Nancy. Hey! Thanks.
Oh, could I get one more? Yeah, sure.
You're coming to this.
"""Come and get sheet faced."""
No, I'm not.
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween. That's just not acceptable.
Well, you can relax. I'm not gonna be alone.
I'm going trickortreating with Will.
All night? Yeah.
No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:00,
listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something.
Sounds like a nice night.
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows, you might even, like, meet someone.
Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off. I missed you.
It's been like an hour. Tell me about it.
Okay. Okay, okay. God.
Sorry.
There's no way that's Mad Max. Yeah. Girls don't play video games.
And even if they did, you can't get 750,000 points on Dig Dug.
It's impossible. But her name is Max.
So what? So, how many Maxes do you know?
I don't know. Zero. That's how many.
She shows up at school
the day after someone with her same name breaks our top score.
I mean, you kidding me? Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max.
And plus she skateboards, so she's pretty awesome.
Awesome? You haven't even spoken a word to her.
I don't have to. I mean, look at her. Shit, I've lost the target.
Oh! There.
Got it. There we go.
"""Stop spying on me, creeps."""
Well, shit.
William Byers.
Your mother's here.
You guys think he's okay?
He's always weird when he has to go in.
I don't know. He's quiet today.
He's always quiet.
You feeling any better?
Will?
Huh?
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.
Hey. What did we talk about, huh? You've got to stop it with the sorries.
Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know.
And listen, you know, there's nothing to be nervous about, you know.
Just tell 'em what you felt last night and what you saw.
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time. So it's gonna be okay. Okay?
Okay.
Hey, buddy. Hey.
Hey.
Sir Will, how are you?
Mom. Pop.
Let's take a look, see what's going on here.
I see you shaved off a pound since we saw you last.
Must be making room for all that Halloween candy.
What's your favorite candy?
Desert island candy, if you had to pick one?
I don't know. Come on.
Life or death situation, what would you pick?
I guess... Reese's Pieces. Reese's Pieces.
Good call. Good call.
I'm more of a Mounds guy,
but I gotta say, peanut butter and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.
All right, tell me what's going on with you.
Tell me about this episode you had.
Well, my friends were there and then they just weren't,
and I was back there again.
In the Upside Down?
All right, so what happened next?
I heard this noise, and so I went outside, and it was worse.
How was it worse?
There was this storm.
Okay. So how did you feel when you saw the storm?
I felt...
frozen.
Heart racing? Just frozen.
Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?
No. Like how you feel when you're scared,
and you can't breathe or talk or do anything.
I felt... felt this evil, like it was looking at me.
It was evil?
Well... What do you think the evil wanted?
To kill.
To kill you?
Not me.
Everyone else.
All right, I'm gonna be honest with you.
It's probably gonna get worse before it gets better.
Worse? He's already had two episodes this month.
He'll likely have more before the month is out.
It's called the Anniversary Effect. And we've seen this with soldiers.
The anniversary of an event brings back traumatic memories.
Sort of opens up the neurological floodgates, so to speak.
So what does this mean for the kid?
He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares?
Yeah, that. Maybe some personality changes.
He might get irritable. He might lash out.
What do we do when that happens?
Okay. Well, from what we know about posttraumatic stress...
And we're still learning, okay? Just treat him normally.
Be patient with him. Don't pressure him to talk.
Just let him lead the way.
I'm sorry, what you're saying is it's gonna get worse and worse
and we're just supposed to pretend it's not happening?
It sounds counterintuitive, I know.
But I assure you that is really the best thing you can do for him.
Listen. I understand what you went through last year. I get it.
But those people are gone. They're gone. Okay?
So if we're gonna get through this,
I just... I need you to realize I'm on your side.
I need you to trust me.
"""Trust me""?"
Are you kidding me? Yeah, I know.
But, you know, university gives out a degree, this guy's got it.
And look, that posttraumatic stuff he's talking about, that stuff is real.
He's gonna be okay. All right?
How's Bob the Brain?
Don't call him that.
Sorry. Old habit.
He's good. We're good.
Good. I'm happy for you.
Really. Hey...
Things get worse, you call me first.
You call me.
Okay.
They're ready for you, sir.
Patty. Sam.
Afternoon, sir.
Looks like another hot one today, huh? Never gets old, sir.
Still no sign?
Jack shit.
Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me. So go home. I'll radio if she comes.
Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me out of here so you can make your move.
Oh, 'cause you're such a threat. That's right.
She will not be able to resist these pearls.
Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock. What?
They're arguing. They're arguing. Oh, my God.
I see that. I don't even know why you need those.
God. You're so stupid.
She's incredible.
She's...
Mad Max.
After dinner, I want you to pick out your toys for the yard sale.
Fine. Two boxes' worth.
Two boxes? You heard me.
I'm fine with you giving away a couple,
but the other ones have way too much emotional value.
Emotional value? They're hunks of plastic, Michael.
You already took away my Atari.
Didn't wanna lose more toys, you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.
I didn't steal. I borrowed.
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski last week either, right?
Or plagiarize that essay? Or graffiti the bathroom stall?
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.
So if your friend jumps off a cliff, you're gonna jump, too?
We know you've had a hard year, Michael. But we've been patient.
This isn't strike one. This isn't even strike three.
It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son.
And if it'd been my coach, you'd be lucky to still be on the team.
Two boxes. Two.
Okay. Ready?
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm so sorry I didn't get to cook.
I was gonna make that baked ziti you guys like so much,
but I just forgot about the time, and before you know it,
"""Oh, my God, it's five o'clock."""
It's fine. It's great. Right. I love KFC.
"So, I noticed a ""For Sale"" sign out in your yard."
Is that the neighbors', or...
You wanna tell them? Go ahead.
We hired a man named Murray Bauman. Have either of you heard of him?
No. No, I don't think so.
He was an investigative journalist for the Chicago SunTimes.
He's pretty well known.
Anyway, he's freelance now, and he agreed to take the case.
That's... That's great.
No, that's really... That's great, right?
Um, what exactly does that mean?
Means he's gonna do what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop
Sorry.
What the Hawkins police haven't been capable of doing.
Means we have a real detective on the case.
It means...
we're going to find our Barb.
If anyone can find her, it's this man.
He already has leads. By God, he's worth every last penny.
Is that why you're selling the house?
Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine.
More than fine.
For the first time in a long time, we're hopeful.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
It's fingerlickin' good. Mmm.
El, are you there? El?
It's me. It's Mike.
It's day 352, 7:40 p.m.
I'm still here.
If you're out there, say something. Or give me a sign.
I won't even say anything. Just... I wanna know if you're okay.
I'm so stupid.
Mike.
Mike? Hello, is that you?
Yeah, it's me, Dustin. What're you doing on this channel again?
I've been trying to reach you all day. We were right. Max is Mad Max.
Yeah, I'm busy. But
What do we do now? We stick to the plan.
Mike's not gonna like it.
Last time I checked, our party is not a dictatorship.
It's a democracy. What if Max says no?
How can Max say no to these?
I told you to stop that.
I'll see you tomorrow. Later.
Mews!
Mews.
Stop. Stop! What?
Come on, you gotta get used to it. This is the future.
Well, put the future down and get me a clean bowl.
Hey, bud. I didn't know what you'd like, so I got a variety.
Take your pick. Whatever you want.
All right.
What are you working on?
Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?
Me. Did someone call you that?
Hey. You can talk to me. You know that, right?
Whatever happened. Will, come on, talk to me.
Stop treating me like that. What? Like what?
Like everyone else. Like there's something wrong with me.
What are you talking about?
Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.
Like I'm a baby. Like I can't handle things on my own.
It doesn't help. It just makes me feel like more of a freak.
You're not a freak. Yeah, I am.
I am.
You know what? You're right.
You are a freak.
What? No, I'm serious. You're a freak.
But what? Do you wanna be normal? Do you wanna be just like everyone else?
Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.
Is that why you don't have any friends?
I have friends, Will.
Then why are you always hanging out with me?
Because you're my best friend, all right?
And I would rather be best friends with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.
You know what I mean?
Okay, look...
Who would you rather be friends with? Bowie or Kenny Rogers?
Ugh.
Exactly. It's no contest.
The thing is, nobody normal
ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world.
You got it? Well...
some people like Kenny Rogers. Kenny Rogers.
I love Kenny Rogers.
What's so funny? Nothing.
Mr. Mom. Perfect!
Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers?
Hey! Cowards.
Hey.
It's okay. Let it go.
Probably just a crank call.
Okay. Holy mackerel!
Let it go. Aw, man!
Hey, what'd we talk about?
No signal.
What? No signal.
It's 815. You're late.
Yeah, I lost track of time. I'll signal next time, all right?
Uh, and it's 8:15. It's not 815.
Eightfifteen.
Now, what did we talk about?
Dinner first, then dessert. Always.
That's a rule.
Yeah?
Yes.
Goodbye, Mike.
Mike?
Mike?
Mike? Mike!
Mike!
Mike!
Bravo team, check in.
What about the Russians? What if they come looking for her?
They don't know where she is.
And she can't contact you without us knowing.
The most important thing is for you to try to go on with your lives
and to keep all of this Top secret. Yeah.
Understood. We're all patriots in this house.
Go back to the beginning. I told you everything.
I understand this is difficult, Michael. I don't know where she is.
And even if I did, I'd never tell you.
I would never tell you.
I know it's difficult to accept,
the stories she told you were not true.
She's a very dangerous individual.
If she contacts you, you must tell us.
Otherwise, you're putting yourself and your entire family at risk.
Do you understand, Michael? Do you understand?
Michael?
Michael?
Fan out.
Somebody check the left side, I'll check the right side.
Oh, Jesus!
Ghost.
Yeah, I see that.
Halloween. Sure is.
But right now, it's breakfast, okay? Come on, let's eat.
They wouldn't see me.
Who wouldn’t see you? The bad men.
What are you talking about?
Trick or treat.
You want to go trickortreating?
You know the rules.
Yes, but Yeah, so you know the answer.
No, but they wouldn't see me. No. Hey. I don't care.
But they wouldn’t see me. I don't care, all right?
You go out there, ghost or not, it's a risk.
We don't take risks. All right?
They're stupid, and...
We're not stupid!
Exactly.
Now, you take that off, sit down and eat. Your food's getting cold.
All right, look...
How about I get off early tonight, and I buy us a bunch of candy,
and we can sit around and get fat, and we watch a scary movie together?
How's that for a compromise?
"""Compromise""?"
COMpromise. Compromise.
How about that's your word for the day? Yeah?
It's something that's kinda inbetween. It's like halfway happy.
By 515?
5:15. Yeah, sure.
Promise?
Yes.
I promise.
Halfway happy.
Will?
Come on, honey, up and at 'em.
Will?
Jonathan? Yeah?
Where's Will?
What? Where's Will?
He's not in his room? No.
Uh...
Will?
What are you doing?
Peeing?
Okay.
Okay.
Let's get this... on.
Oh!
You need some tape. Hold on.
What's this?
Nothing.
Did you have another episode?
No, it's just, um... a sketch for a story I'm writing.
All right.
Three, two, one...
Great. Hold up the proton blaster.
All right, now turn to the light.
Oh! I want to see those pearls. Yeah!
Who you gonna call?
Oh!
Adorable, baby. Just adorable!
God. You are such a nerd. Shut up.
No wonder you only hang out with boys.
Erica! Just the facts.
Nerd.
My God, I love this costume. Keep it up.
All right, that's the last one. No, just one more. Come on, please?
Ah!
Can I go to school? Wait, wait.
"Okay, say, ""Who you gonna call?"" No!"
♪ Who you gonna call? ♪ ♪ Ghostbusters! ♪
Hey, Spengler!
Egon! Yeah! Venkman!
Whoa! Whoa!
What? Why are you Venkman?
Because I'm Venkman. No, I'm Venkman.
Why can't there be two Venkmans?
Because there's only one Venkman in real life. We planned this months ago.
I'm Venkman, Dustin's Stantz, you're Egon, and you're Winston.
I specifically didn't agree to Winston. Yes, you did!
I don't think he did. No one wants to be Winston, man.
What's wrong with Winston?
What's wrong with Winston? He joined the team super late,
he's not funny, and he's not even a scientist!
Yeah, but he's still cool. If he's cool, then you be Winston.
I can't! Why not?
Because... Because you're not black?
I didn't say that! You thought it.
I didn't say that! Mike!
Guys... Guys! Guys!
Why is no one else wearing costumes?
Crap.
Oh, my God!
When do people make these decisions?
Everyone dressed up last year.
It's a conspiracy, I'm telling you. Just be cool.
Who you gonna call? The nerds!
We gonna do this? Not right now. We look like morons.
Maybe she likes Ghostbusters?
Of course she likes Ghostbusters, but that's not the point.
The point is we're dressed up and she isn't.
I didn't bring regular clothes. You?
No.
Then we have no choice. We gotta do this. It's now or never.
Right. Let's engage.
We could ask her after class.
Yup. Okay.
See? It's an exact match.
But... why would he lie to me? He's a kid, Joyce.
I mean, you heard him describe these episodes.
It's not like he's describing a nightmare. He talks about them like they're real.
Yeah, because they're not nightmares, they're flashbacks.
I know a couple guys who have had these things,
and it feels like you're there, like it's happening.
Then what the hell is this? Owens said it would get worse.
That place... What do you wanna do?
You wanna take him back to Chicago?
Well, there's that guy in Boston that's supposed to be
They're all a bunch of quacks.
They'll all tell you the same thing, just cost you more money.
I think he's right... about trauma. And we're coming up on a year, you know.
I think everybody's on edge. Me, you... Will most of all.
I think we just gotta get through the next few weeks.
Nothing's gonna go back to the way that it was.
Not really.
But it'll get better.
In time.
Here. Thank you.
Jesus! Hopper...
Brings me back to old times.
What?
Sharing my cigarettes between... Fifth and sixth period.
Yeah, under the steps.
Mr. Cooper caught us that time, remember?
"He was like, ""Hey, assholes."""
We ran. We just ran.
God, I want this to be over.
I know.
How's it looking out there, cowboy?
Uh, you know, Doc. The usual.
Nice and nasty with a chance of radioactivity.
Oh, yeah, it's barbecued all right. Anyone hungry?
And...
...we're back on!
There was this storm.
Okay. So how did you feel when you saw the storm?
I felt frozen.
Actually frozen? Cold?
No, like how you feel when you're scared,
and you can't breathe or talk or do anything.
I felt... I felt this evil
Nancy, this isn't you.
Barb, just go ahead and go home, okay?
Nancy?
Nancy!
Nancy.
What's going on? Are you okay?
I can't keep doing this. Doing what?
Pretending like everything's okay. What are you talking about?
Barbara.
It's like everyone forgot.
It's like nobody cares. Except her parents.
And now they're selling their house. Nance
And they're going to spend the rest of their lives looking for her.
I know. It's destroying them.
I know. Okay? I get it. But listen, there's nothing we can do about it.
Yeah, we could tell them the truth.
Well, you know that we can't do that. We don't have to tell them everything.
This isn't some game, Nance. If they found out that we told any...
They could put us in jail. Okay? Or worse, they could destroy our families.
They could do anything they want. Okay? Just think about what you're saying.
Hey...
Hey, hey...
Hey, it's...
It's hard, but let's...
let's just go to Tina's stupid party...
wear our stupid costumes
that we've been working on for a stupid amount of time,
and just pretend like we're stupid teenagers, okay?
Can we just do that, just for tonight?
Okay.
Come here.
Um...
Hi, Max. I'm Dustin, and this is
Lucas. Yeah, I know.
The stalkers.
Uh, no. Actually...
We weren't stalking you.
No, we were just concerned because, you know, you're new and all.
Yeah, for your safety.
Mmmhmm. There are a lot of bullies here.
So many bullies, it's crazy. Yeah.
Is that why you're wearing proton packs? Well, these don't function. But...
I do have this handydandy little trap here.
And look, it even opens and closes. Look, look, look...
Voilà!
It's cool, right?
No? Okay. But, um...
So, we were talking last night, and you're new here,
so you probably don't have any friends to take you trickortreating,
and you're scared of bullies, so we were thinking
that it would be okay if you come with us.
"""It'd be okay""? Yeah. Our party's a democracy,"
the majority voted you could come.
Didn't realize it was such an honor to go trickortreating with you.
We know where to get the fullsized candy bars.
We figured you'd want in.
That's presumptuous of you.
Yeah. Totally. Uh, so, um... you'll come?
We're meeting at the Maple Street culdesac at 7:00.
That's 7:00 on the dot!
"""Presumptuous."""
That's a good thing, right?
Is it bad?
Lucas, is it bad? Lucas? Son of a bitch, Lucas. Is it bad?
How does it feel? Like pouring pure silk onto my skin.
Inhuman. Relentless.
Arnold Schwarzenegger is... The Term
Well, I'm stunned. I don't know what to think.
Don't you love me? Of course I love you.
It's just that it's so sudden. I mean, it's not like you.
Erica, I am this way because of you.
"Me? ""Me?"""
Mmmhmm.
You have made me wild and impetuous,
"just like you. ""Impetuous."""
People are going to be aghast.
"""People are going to be aghast."" They're gonna love it."
I mean, it's gonna stun the whole town. The whole world!
Erica, tell me that you will marry me, in this house, tonight...
Hey.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
What's your name?
What're you doing out here in the cold?
So, you're telling me that Merrill poisoned your farm,
because he thinks you poisoned his, which, of course, you didn't?
No, sir. And I got me an alibi the night he accuses me.
My Jenny and her boys were in town. I was with them all night.
Did you actually see Merrill? No need. That man done lost his mind.
Went around slandering me, threatening all sorts of madness.
A pumpkin conspiracy.
Hawkins' very own Chinatown.
Merrill threatening to do something and him actually doing something
are two very different things.
You got a better explanation? Cold weather.
It's October. Yeah, it's a cold one.
You see these hands? Yeah.
You know why they look like that? Because you're old?
You're damn straight.
And I've been doing this a long time, Chief. A long time.
And I ain't never seen anything the likes of this.
None of us have. None of us?
Merrill didn't just hit me last night. He hit damn near everyone.
What are you talking about?
Jack O'Dell, Pete Freeling, Rick Neary, the Christensens.
All of their crops, dead.
Give me those names again.
You're late again.
Yeah, I had to get catchup homework. Jesus. I don't care.
You're late again, and you're skating home.
Do you hear me?
God, this place is such a shithole.
It's not that bad. No?
Mmm!
You smell that, Max? That's actually shit.
Cow shit. I don't see any cows.
Clearly, you haven't met the highschool girls.
So what, you like it here now? No.
Then why are you defending it? I'm not.
Sure sounds like it.
It's just we're stuck here, so... Hmm.
You're right. We're stuck here.
And whose fault is that?
Yours.
What'd you say? Nothing.
Did you say it's my fault? No.
You know whose fault it is.
Say it.
Max...
say it.
Say it!
Really, everyone dressed up last year.
Billy, slow down.
Oh, these your new hick friends? No! I don't know them.
I guess you won't care if I hit 'em, then?
I get bonus points, I get 'em all in one go?
No, Billy, stop. It's not funny.
Hey, guys?
Billy, come on, stop it. It's not funny. Stop!
Go! Mike, you need to haul ass!
Billy, stop it!
Whoa! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Yeah! That was a close one, huh?
Holy shit!
Was that...
Mad Max.
Now, you tryin' to tell me, with a straight face, cold did this?
How far does it go?
Hey, Chief, you copy?
Uh...
Hey, Chief.
How's it looking over there?
Like a giant pissed all over Jack's bean field.
Smells, too. It smell over there?
Uh, yeah, little bit.
Smells like a nursing home, man.
Listen. I want you guys to track the rot, see how far it goes.
Just, uh, mark anything that's dead.
That's gonna take some time. So take it.
And, look, we don't know what caused this. Could be poison.
So don't touch anything without gloves.
Copy that, Chief.
You got any marking flags?
"So you hit ""T"" to zoom in, and ""W"" zooms back out."
See? Easypeasy.
Just make sure to turn off the power to save energy there.
Listen. Stay close to your brother, okay?
And listen, listen, listen...
If you get a bad feeling or anything, you tell him to take you straight home.
You promise? Okay.
Are you ready, bud? Yeah.
Be safe.
I hope it doesn't suck!
I just don't get what she sees in him.
What?
Bob.
At least he doesn't treat me different.
I mean, I can't even go trickortreating by myself. It's lame.
What? You think I'm lame?
No, but it's not like Nancy's coming to watch over Mike, you know?
Will! Hey!
Hey, don't cross the streams. Don't cross the streams!
Hey, listen.
Yeah?
If I let you go on your own, you promise to stay in the neighborhood?
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, totally. And be back at Mike's by 9:00.
Yeah. Deal?
Yeah, deal. All right.
Hey, Will. Don't let any of your spazzy friends use this, all right?
Okay.
I hope it doesn't suck.
Will!
Egon! Yeah! You ready for tonight, man?
Awesome!

Yeah! Fortytwo!
We got ourselves a new Keg King!
Billy! Billy! Billy! That's how you do it, Hawkins!
Billy! Billy! Billy!
We got ourselves a new Keg King, Harrington.
Yeah, that's right! Yeah. Eat it, Harrington.
What's in this?
Pure fuel! Pure fuel!
Whoo!
Hey... Whoa, whoa! Hey... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy.
Take it easy. Nance, Nance, Nance...
We're just being stupid teenagers for the night. Wasn't that the deal?

Come on, you're stiff as a board. Relax. I'm sorry. It's...

I know.
It's just every time he's away from me, it's like I can't function.
I know it sounds silly. No, it's not silly. It's not silly.
What if we were to move out of Hawkins... together?
What? I know.
Whoa, Nellie, right? No, I just...
I've been thinking about what you said.
About how we've got all these memories here,
and you wish you had enough money to move.
Well, my parents are selling their house in Maine.
There's a RadioShack nearby. I'm sure they'd take me on.
We could just...
My turn to be silly now. Bob...
No, it's fine. Wine makes me crazy.
Oh, it's just so hard to explain.
It's just this... This is not a normal family.
It could be.
It could be.

No one likes 3 Musketeers. Yeah, it's just nougat.

Just nougat? It is top three for me.
Top three? Top three!
Oh, God. Give me a break.
Seriously, I can just eat a whole bowl of nougat. Straight up.
Holy shit! You should have seen the look on your faces.
And you? Who screams like that? You sound like a little girl.
Hey, you guys coming or not? Oh, I heard we should hit up Loch Nora.

Yeah!
You're dead.
Yeah, you got me, kid.

Did something happen? No. What? No.
Are you constipated again?
No. Mom!
Okay, you're acting weird.

Whoa! Ah!
Awesome, right? Yeah... I rigged the trap with, uh,
a motor to make it look like I caught a ghost.
Just like the movie.
Oh, Dusty. Yeah.
Funny. Look at that. Look at that.
I told you to keep quiet.
All you had to do was stay still for one minute.
One minute.
Sorry, Yertle.
Temporary eviction, buddy.
What are you, little guy?

You hungry?

Go on, eat.

Know the great thing about it? It's only 8,000 calories.
You visited him again last night?
He says he needs me.
Want me to go check on him?
I know that you miss him, all right?
But it's too dangerous.
You're the last thing he needs right now.
You're gonna see him. Soon.
And not just in that head of yours. You're gonna see him in real life.
I feel like I'm making progress with these people.
Friends don't lie.
What?
"You say ""soon"" on day 21."
"You say ""soon"" on day 205."
"You now say ""soon"" on day 326? What is this?"

"When is ""soon""?"
"""Soon"" is when..."
it's not dangerous anymore.
When?
I don't know. On day 500?
I don't know. On day 600?
I don't know. Day 700?
On day 800? No!
I need to see him. Tell me! I said I
Oh! Shit! Shit!
Friends don't lie!
Jesus. Have you seen them?
We're looking, Mom. Yeah, we're... we're looking.
Aha! Found 'em. Oh!
Hiding under some jeans, sneaky little buggers.
Thank you. Thank you. You're a life saver.
Can you take Will to school today? I cannot be late again.
He's staying over now? Can you just take Will, please?
I can take him.
Will you make sure he gets in okay? Yeah, of course.
What do you say, big guy? Wanna go for a ride in the Bobmobile?
Mr. Henderson, you know the rules. Five at a time.
Yep.
One, two, three, four and five.
Ten.
You already have five books checked out.
My mistake.
However...
I am on a curiosity voyage, and I need my paddles to travel.
These books...
These books are my paddles.
Five at a time.
Are you shitting me? Excuse me?
What the hell is...
Mr. Henderson! I need my paddles!
Was that you I heard milling around last night, or was that a ghost?
Yeah. Me, probably.
Another nightmare? Um... no.
Did I ever tell you about Mr. Baldo?
Mr. Baldo? Yeah.
I was a little younger than you,
standing in line for the Ferris wheel at the Roane County fair.
Mmmhmm. And suddenly,
I feel this fat white glove tap me on the shoulder.
I spin around, and there he is.
Mr. Baldo.
"""Hey, kiddo, would you like a balloon?"""
Go ahead, laugh. It's funny.
It wasn't funny back then, I can tell you that.
I couldn't get him out of my head.
Every night, he would come to me in my dreams.
And every night when he came to me...
I ran.
It got so bad that I made my mom stay in the room with me
until I could fall asleep every night.
Really? Really.
It went on like that for months.
And then one day, the nightmares suddenly stopped.
Wanna know how? How?
Well, I fell asleep...
and just like always, Mr. Baldo came to me.
Only this time, I didn't run.
This time, I stood my ground.
I just looked at Mr. Baldo
"in his stupid face, and I said, ""Go away. Go away!"""
Just like that, he was gone.
Never saw him again.
Easypeasy, right?
Easypeasy.
Just like that.
I still don't get why they call him zombie boy.
I mean, I get it. He got lost in the woods for a week or something,
but why is he a zombie? Because everyone thought he was dead?
Yeah. I mean, we had a funeral for him and everything.
After a week?
Well, see, some other kid drowned at the quarry.
We thought it was Will because his body was super decomposed.
What?
Okay, that's not funny.
It's not a joke, all right? It's public knowledge.
You can ask anybody.
Except Will, because he is really sensitive about it.
All right?
Okay.
Have a great day, kiddo.
The case of Phineas Gage
is one of the great medical curiosities of all time.
Phineas was a railroad worker in 1848 who had a nightmarish accident.
A large iron rod was driven completely through his head.
Phineas miraculously survived. He seemed fine.
And physically, yes, he was.
But his injury resulted in a complete change to his personality.
So much so that friends that knew him
"started referring to him as ""No longer Gage."""
At the time, this was known as the American Crowbar Case.
Although it wasn't a
I am so sorry, Mr. Clarke.
Really, I'm so sorry. Please continue with the class.
Don't mind me.
Really, continue, please. Thanks.
Although it wasn't a crowbar, it was a rod, as I said.
We have to meet. All of us. At lunch, AV Club.
Why?
I have something that you won't believe.
AV Club. Lunch.
Dustin! Yes, my lord?
Would you care to join the class now? Please, yes.
The case of Phineas Gage. Phineas Gage.
Page 104. 104. 104.
Focus. Focusing. Focusing.
AV Club.
And he began to curse, using terrible words
that I don't dare repeat here.
And we found some more by Gilbert's farm.
Some real nasty stuff.
It was sticky. All right. Where else?
That was it, Chief.
That was it, or you get tired of looking?
It was getting dark. I mean, it was really dark.
They're called flashlights, you dipshits.
Oh, okay. Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
More lady problems, Chief?
Hey, Chief! Where you going?
You want us to go back out there?
Why's he gotta kick the door? Hey, Chief!
My granddad used to live here.
Long time ago.
I mainly just use it for storage now.
Lot of history here.
So, uh... what do you think?
It's a workinprogress. You know, it's, uh...
It takes a little imagination, but, uh...
once we fix it up, it's gonna be nice.
Real nice.
This is your new home.
Home.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
All right, this...
this is music.

Okay.
Now, this is called a trip wire.
It's like an alarm.
You, uh, set it up like this.
And then, anybody gets close,
it's gonna make a loud noise like, uh, gunfire.
Bang!
Those bad men aren't gonna find ya.
All right? Not way the hell out here.
We'll take some precautions.
There's gonna be a couple ground rules.
Rule number one:
always keep the curtains drawn.
Rule number two:
only open the door if you hear my secret knock.
And rule number three:
don't ever go out alone, especially not in the daylight.
That's it. Three rules.
I call 'em the, uh...
Don't Be Stupid Rules.
'Cause we're not stupid.
Right?
Not stupid.
Harrington, right?
I heard you used to run this school. That true?
King Steve, they used to call you, huh?
Then you turned bitch.
Hey, maybe you should just shut up and just play the game.
Whoo!
That's what I'm talking about! Whoo!
Steve?
What are you doing here? What do you think?
Where were you this morning? I missed first period.
I figured Jonathan would take you.
Wha... What are you talking about?
Jesus, you really can't handle your alcohol.
Uh...
You remember going to Tina's party last night, right?
Yes. And then what?
I remember dancing, and...
spilling some punch.
You got mad at me because I was drunk...
and then you took me home.
No, see, that's where your mind gets a little bit fuzzy.
That was your other boyfriend. That was... That was Jonathan.
I don't understand. It's pretty simple, Nancy.
You were just telling it like it is. What?
Uh...
apparently, uh...
we killed Barb and I don't care, 'cause I'm bullshit...
and our whole... our whole relationship is bullshit, and...
I mean, pretty much everything is just bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
Oh, yeah, also, you don't love me.
I was drunk, Steve. I don't remember any of that.
So that makes everything that you said... It's what? Just bullshit, too?
Yes. Well, then tell me.
Tell you what?
You love me.
Really?
Harrington!
Dude, we need you, man. That douchebag's killing us. Let's go!
All right! Come on!
I think that you're bullshit.
His name is d'Artagnan.
Cute, right?
D'Artagnan? Dart for short.
And he was in your trash? Foraging for food.
You wanna hold him? No, no.
He doesn't bite. I don't want to
Oh, God, he's slimy!
Ugh, he's like a living booger.
Ugh, oh, God!
What is he?
My question exactly.
At first, I thought it was some type of pollywog.
Pollywog? It's another word for tadpole.
A tadpole is the larval stage of a toad. I know what a tadpole is.
All right, then you know that most tadpoles are aquatic, right?
Well, Dart, he isn't. He doesn't need water.
Yeah, but aren't there nonaquatic pollywogs?
Terrestrial pollywogs? Yep. Two to be exact.
Indirana semipalmata.
And the Adenomera andreae.
One's from India, one's from South America.
So how did one end up in my trash?
Maybe some scientists brought it here, and it escaped?
Do you guys see that?
Looks like something is moving inside of it.
Whoa.
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you, little guy.
I know you don't like that. It's okay.
And there's another thing.
Reptiles, they're coldblooded. Ectothermic, right?
They love heat, the sun. Dart hates it. It hurts him.
So, if he's not a pollywog or a reptile...
Then I've discovered a new species.
We gotta show him to Mr. Clarke.
What if he steals my discovery? He's not gonna steal your discovery.
You know, I'm thinking about calling it Dustonious pollywogus.
What do you think? I think you're an idiot.
When I become rich and famous for this one day,
don't come crawling back, saying,
"""Oh, my God, Dustin, I'm so sorry for being mean to you back in 8th grade."
"Oh, my God."""
Have a nice day. Thank you.
Baloney?
Mmm.
Last night was fun. Mmmhmm.
I'm sorry if I overstepped anything.
No! No, you didn't.
Okay.
I mean...
I... I like you so much.
Not just you, everything that comes with you.
Your family, your boys.
And I hope it's not wishful thinking, but...
I kinda feel like I'm breaking through with them.
Not so much Jonathan. He's a tough cookie to crack, but...
Yeah.
With Will, I don't know, I feel like we're connecting.
He likes you, too.
Yeah? Mmmhmm.
I can tell.
Good.
Oh, there was... something else I was gonna mention, but...
It's not a big deal at all, but...
I just noticed this morning that my JVC was a little dinged up.
Your what? The video camera.
Oh. Yeah.
It still works fine and everything. I just...
I went back and watched the tape...
and there were some older kids picking on Will.
What? They scared him.
Who were they? Were they the Zimmerman brothers again?
Um, I don't know.
They were wearing masks or sort of makeup and...
Maybe. They were the right age.
I'll kill them.
I swear to God, I will... I will kill them.
That's what I love about you. You punch back.
I was never really one to put up a fight.
I struggled a lot like Will when I was a kid.
With bullies.
It's the ones like us, that don't punch back,
that people really take advantage of, you know?
They rub your nose in it, just a little bit more.
I don't know why they do that.
Maybe it makes them feel powerful.
I don't know.
But, hey, look at me now.
I get to date Joyce Byers. Ha!
Are you kidding me? I get to date...
It all works out in the end, doesn't it?
Yes, it does.
Grass, crops, trees.
Everything in this area is either dead or dying,
and that's a radius of over three miles.
And it all leads back to here.
See, these patterns here are really pretty. I like the design.
It's almost psychedelic.
This is a joke to you, huh? No, it's not a joke. I just...
I don't understand what this has to do with me, Chief Hopper.
Whatever is happening is spreading from this place, from this lab.
That's impossible. It's... The last burn was two days ago.
It's contained.
What if there's a leak? A leak?
I don't know, man. You're the scientist. Exactly.
And I'm telling you there's nothing to worry about.
Convince me. Convince you?
Yeah. You and your egghead friends
go out there to every area on this map and you run your tests,
or whatever the hell it is you do, and you see if anything comes up.
All right, so...
So you're... you're giving me orders now?
No.
I keep things nice and quiet for you... Mmmhmm.
...and you keep your shit out of my town.
That is the deal.
I have done my part, now you do yours.
Convince me.
So, he asked you to take me home?
Yeah.
Yeah, he was upset.
I mean, he was... He was really upset.
But he was still worried about you.
Hey.
You need to cut yourself some slack, okay?
People say stupid things when they're wasted.
Things they don't mean.
Yeah, but that's the thing.
What if I did mean it?
All this time, I've been trying so hard to pretend like everything's fine,
but it's not.
I... I feel like there's this...
I don't know, like this...
Like there's this weight you're carrying around with you.
All the time.
I feel it, too.
Yeah, but it's different for you.
Will came home.
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.
But he's not the same.
I try to be there for him, you know, to help him, but...
I don't know.
I mean, maybe...
maybe things just can't go back to the way they were.
Doesn't that make you mad?
Mad?
Yeah, that those... those people who did this,
who ruined so many lives, they just get away with it.
The people responsible for this...
they're dead. Do you really believe that?
Your mom's boyfriend.
He works at RadioShack, right? Yeah.
Why?
What are you thinking?
Do you wanna skip fourth period?
Isn't this fun?
Pump your feet.
"""I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her..."
because she didn't live very long after that, you see.
She died of a fever when I was just three months old.
I do wish she'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother.
"I think it would be so sweet to say 'mother.'"""
Do I have a mother?
Yeah, of course you have a mother.
You couldn't really be born without one.
Where is she?
She...
She's not around anymore.
Gone?
Yeah.
I'm sorry about that, kid.
"""And, uh, father died four days afterwards from fever, too."
That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits' end,
so Mrs. Thomas said to me, what to do with me.
You see, nobody wanted me even then.
"It seems to be my fate."""
Is your mom here?
Sweetie?
School.
Where is school?
The school? It's, uh... it's about a mile that way.
At least.
Where are your parents?
Look, Mommy, look.
RadioShack, Bob Newby speaking. How can I help ya?
Bob, it's Joyce.
Hey, Joyce, how ya doing?
Hey, um... I'm trying to watch your video thingy,
and the tape, it's... it's tiny. It's like it's shrunk.
That's 'cause it's a VHSC, not a VHS.
You gotta find the RFP1U with coaxial cable
so you can connect the video ins and outs.
Bob, English.
Right. Sorry. Um...
No, yeah, I did the coaxial things in the back, so I...
This one just goes into the camera itself?
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's blue. I think it's working.
I was thinking maybe tonight
Joyce?
So you hit T to zoom in, and W zooms back out.
See? Easypeasy.
Watch it, zombie boy.
Trick or treat, freak.
Boo!
Loser.
Mike! Mike!
Will, you coming? Let's go show Mr. Clarke.
What?
What?
It's about d'Artagnan.
This is the reason I was late for class.
Pretty neat. These doors function?
Well, yeah, obviously. But it's not about the trap.
It's what's inside.
Now, this very well may change your perception of the world.
Consider my interest piqued.
All right, first, let's just clarify that...
this is my discovery, not yours.
Dustin, Jesus! Just show him!
I'm just trying to clarify Dustin!
Okay, fine.
Stop!
I'm sorry, Mr. Clarke. It was just a stupid prank.
What are you doing? I told him to stop. We need to go.
Mike! Right now. Right now!
So, your sister coming or what?
Screw it. That little shit can skate home.
And don't call her that. What?
Sister. She's not my sister.
Hello? Hello?
Guys, come on. Can I come in yet? No!
I don't understand. What do you not understand?
Will saw something that looked like Dart last year?
Kind of, but there was no tail.
But then he heard it yesterday. The exact same sound.
Why didn't you tell us before? I wasn't sure.
A coincidence. Or not.
What if when Will was stuck in the Upside Down,
he somehow acquired True Sight?
True Sight?
It gives you the power to see into the ethereal plane.
Elaborate.
Maybe these episodes that Will keeps having aren't really flashbacks at all.
Maybe they're real.
Maybe Will can somehow see into the Upside Down.
So that would mean... Dart is from the Upside Down.
We have to take him to Hopper. I agree.
No way. If we take him to Hopper, Dart's good as dead.
Maybe he should be. How can you say that?
How can you not? He's from the Upside Down.
Maybe. But even if he is, it doesn't automatically mean that he's bad.
That's like saying just because someone's from the Death Star
doesn't make them bad. We have a bond.
A bond? Just because he likes nougat?
No, because he trusts me!
He trusts you?
Yes, I promised I would take care of him.
Guys, what's going on? Come on.
Don't hurt him. Only if he attacks.
Just open it already.
Holy shit!
Oh, shit!
No!
What the...
Oh, shit!
Where'd he go?
What was that? Dart!
What? You let him escape!
Why did you attack him? Come on.
Don't hurt him. Don't you hurt him!
Jonathan?
Uh... Mrs. Wheeler.
What a pleasant surprise. Yeah.
Uh, we have a test tomorrow. Hmm.
Oh, did you go shopping? Oh, uh, yeah. My Walkman broke.
Aw! Bummer.
Anyway, we should go. It's a really big test.
Yeah. So...
Stressful. Very.
Bye, Mrs. Wheeler. Bye! It's good to see you.
Okay, are you sure about this?
No.
Hello. Marsha speaking.
Hello?
Hello?
Mrs. Holland. Hi, it's, um... it's Nancy.
Nancy?
I, uh...
I need to tell you something. Something about Barb.
About that night. I, uh...
I, uh... I haven't been honest with you.
But I can't tell you here on the phone.
Meet me tomorrow, Forrest Hills Park, 9:00 a.m.
Don't tell anyone.
And don't call me back here. It's dangerous.
Nancy, what is this?
I just need you to trust me. Please.
Well, you were right about these pumpkins.
Some nasty stuff.
And the smell... Gee, mother of God.
What exactly do you think is going on
Well, I told you what I think.
But we'll run the tests, and we'll see what comes up.
In the meantime, I just need you to keep the area clear for us.
I don't think it'll be more than a day or two.
What do you want me to tell people?
I'm sure you'll figure something out.
Hey, Chief, you copy? Yeah.
Do you remember that Russian girl Murray was going on about the other day?
Yeah, well, now I'm thinking he's not so crazy after all.
Stay where you are. Do not move.
East is clear. No sign of Dart.
Where'd you go, you little bastard?
West is clear, too. Will?
South is clear. Lucas?
Anything?
Excuse me! Mr. Sinclair!
Sorry, I was looking for study hall.
Bye.
Nothing here, man.
What the hell are you doing? What are you doing?
Why are you in here? Looking for Dart.
This is the boys' room. Yeah, so?
So you should go home.
Why do you hate me so much? I don't hate you.
How can I hate you? I don't know you. But you don't want me in your party.
Correct. Why not?
Because you're annoying. Also, we don't need another party member.
I'm our paladin, Will's our cleric, Dustin's our bard, Lucas is our ranger,
and El is our mage.
El? Who's El? Someone. No one.
Someone or no one?
She was in our party a long time ago. She moved away, okay?
She was a mage?
Well, what could she do? Like, magic tricks or something?
Well, I could be your zoomer.
That's not even a real thing. It could be.
See? Zoomer. Mindblowing.
Come on, you know you're impressed.
I don't see any tricks. You're just going around in a circle.
If it's so easy, you try it.
No. Why not?
I don't know how.
So, then you admit it's kind of impressive.
I think if I spent, like, all day practicing, I could do that.
I would give you a million bucks if you could.
Okay, you're making me dizzy.
Please just stop. I'll stop when I join your party.
Come on, just stop. It's a simple question. Am I in or out?
Jesus! Are you all right?
Yeah, yeah. I think so.
What happened? I don't know.
It was like a magnet or something pulling on my board.
I know that sounds crazy.
Come on, come on, come on!
Hawkins Middle. May I help you?
Yes. Hi, Doris. It's Joyce.
Uh, Joyce Byers. Joyce.
Uh, Will has AV Club today. Could you transfer me to Mr. Clarke?
Mr. Clarke? Huh. You know what? What?
I just saw him leave for the day. Maybe AV was canceled?
What? Would you like me to
Guys...
I found him. Where?
In the bathroom by Mr. Salerno's.
Copy that.
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Hey, buddy.
Come here. You know I won't hurt you.
It's okay. It's just me.
You're okay.
Let's go. Down here. We're coming!
Stay low. Keep quiet.
Where's Dart?
I don't know. Not here. What?
He said by Salerno's, right? Yeah, maybe Will has him.
Where is Will?
Only this time, I didn't run.
This time, I stood my ground.
"I said, ""Go away. Go away!"""
Go away!
Go away!
Go away!
Go away! Go away!
Go away!
Easypeasy, right?
Easypeasy.
Just like that.
Will!
Will!
Dustin! Mrs. Byers?
What's going on? Where's Will?
The field!
Will. I just found him like this!
I think he's having another episode!
Will! Will! Will!
Sweetie, wake up! It's Mom!
Will!
Will, wake up!
Can you hear me?
Will, please, just wake up.
Please, wake up!
It's Mom!
It's me!
Okay, that totally freaked me out.
Did that not freak you guys out?
Two episodes in two days. It's getting worse.
You think it's True Sight?
What's True Sight?
It's nothing.
I can't remember.
I need you to try.
I... I was on the field and... and then it...
it all just went blank, and... and then you were there.
Will, I need you to tell me the truth.
I am.
This shape, I saw it on the video tape from Halloween night.
It's the same shape as... as your drawing.
These episodes that you're having, I think Dr. Owens is wrong.
I think they're real.
But... but I can't help you if I don't know what's going on.
So, you have to talk to me. Please.
No more secrets, okay?
Okay.
Did... did you see this thing again on the field?
Yes.
What... what is it?
I don't know.
It's almost more like a feeling.
Like the one you had that night at the arcade?
Yes.
What does it want?
I don't know.
It came for me, and...
Go away!
And I tried. I tried to make it go away.
But it got me, Mom.
Well, what does that mean?
I felt it... everywhere.
Everywhere.
I I still feel it.
I just want this to be over.
It's okay. It's okay. Hey.
Listen. Look, look at me.
I will never, ever let anything bad happen to you ever again.
Whatever's going on in you, we're gonna fix it. I will fix it.
I promise. I'm here.
"""Friends don't lie."" Isn't that your bullshit saying?"
Hey, hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me!
Where'd you go on your little field trip, huh?
Where?
Did you go see Mike?
He didn't see me.
Yeah, well, that mother and her daughter did and they called the cops.
Now, did anyone else see you?
Anyone at all?
Come on, I need you to think!
Nobody saw me!
You put us in danger.
You realize that, right?
You promised...
I go!
And I never leave!
Nothing ever happens!
Yeah! Nothing happens and you stay safe!
You lie!
I don't lie! I protect and I feed and I teach!
And all I ask of you is that you follow three simple rules.
Three rules. And you know what?
You can't even do that!
You're grounded.
You know what that means?
It means no Eggos...
And no TV for a week.
All right, knock it off. Let go.
Okay.
Two weeks.
Let go!
A month! No!
Well, congratulations.
You just graduated from no TV for a month to no TV at all!
No!
No! No. No!
You have got to understand that there are consequences to your actions.
You are like Papa!
Really?
I'm like that psychotic son of a bitch?
Wow! All right. You wanna go back in the lab?
One phone call. I can make that happen.
I hate you.
Yeah, well, I'm not so crazy about you, either.
You know why? 'Cause you're a brat.
You know what that word means?
How about that be your word for the day, huh? Brat.
Why don't we look it up? BRAT.
Brat.
Hey! What the hell is wrong with you?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Open this door!
Open the damn door!
You wanna go out in the world?
You better grow up!
Grow the hell up!
Mom?
Will?
Hello?
Do you like those grapes, Holly?
Hey, Mom, I was thinking about staying the night at Stacey's tonight?
We were gonna have a girl's night.
Romantic comedies, do our nails, gossip...
Sure! That sounds like fun.
Toast? No?
Hey. Hey.
Did you see your mom?
No, she was sleeping. But I left a note.
You don't have to do this, you know.
Stop saying that.
Hawkins Police. Flo, it's Joyce again.
Oh, hi, Joyce. Listen, I gave him your message
He's still not there? No, but
Did he get any of my messages from yesterday? Did you give
Yes, do you wanna talk to No, no, I need Hopper.
Just tell him to call me the second he gets in. Please.
Thank you. Bye.
Hey. How you feeling, sleepyhead?
Any better? Mmmmmm.
Same as last night? Still weird?
Yeah.
All right.
Hmm.
Okay, let me see.
Is it a fever?
No. Uh, actually, it's cold.
Do you feel cold?
No. Just a little out of it.
Like I haven't really woken up yet.
You promised no doctor.
And I meant it. No doctor.
You know what?
I'm gonna run you a nice bath and it'll warm you up
and hopefully get you feeling better.
How's that sound? Okay.
Morning, Dart.
Got you some breakfast.
Your favorite.
I gotta go to school,
but I'll be back soon. Sound good?
Stop being a baby and do it already!
This is so disgusting. Is this really necessary?
What the hell's going on?
What do you think? We're looking for Dart.
Jesus! Oh!
Ugh!
Well, well, well.
Look who finally decided to show up.
After I drew the short straw. Real convenient.
You stink!
Hi, Max.
Hi.
Where's Will? He'll be here.
Are you just gonna stand there?
Or you gonna help?
All living things, from complex mammals
to singlecelled organisms, instinctively respond to danger.
Expose a bacterium to a toxic chemical, and it will flee.
Or deploy some other defense mechanism.
We're very much the same.
When we encounter danger, our hearts start pounding.
Our palms start to sweat.
These are the signs of the physical and emotional state we call...
fear.
Hey, you reached Jim.
I'm probably doing something incredible right now and I can't...
Mom.
Yeah, sweetie, what is it?
It's too hot.
I... I can cool it down a little bit, baby,
but we gotta get your body temp back up. No.
What?
He likes it cold.
Hey, kid.
Listen, um...
about last night, I, uh...
I want this place cleaned up by the time I get back
and then maybe I'll consider fixing the TV.
You hear me?
Come in, Hop.
Come in, Hop.
Come in, Hop.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way in,
and, yes, I do know what time it is.
Joyce Byers has called eight times already this morning.
Eight times.
For my sake, please deal with her!
Let's go. Pass it up now. Get open!
All right! All right, all right!
King Steve. King Steve, everyone.
I like it. Playing tough today.
Jesus! Do you ever stop talking? Come on!
What?
You afraid the coach is gonna bench you now that I'm here? Huh?
You were moving your feet.
Plant them next time, draw a charge.
Don't sweat it, Harrington.
Today's just not your day, man.
Yeah. Not your week.
You and the princess break up for one day,
she's running off with the freak's brother.
Oh, shit. You don't know.
Jonathan and the princess skipped yesterday. Still haven't shown.
But that must just be a coincidence, right?
Don't take it too hard, man.
A pretty boy like you has got nothing to worry about.
Plenty of bitches in the sea.
Am I right?
I'll be sure to leave you some.
It's 15 past.
Yeah, I know.
Just give him time.
That guy. There.
What? He just... just talked to himself.
Duck, duck, duck,
duck, duck...
Duck, duck, duck...
Duck, duck, duck...
Duck...
Duck, duck...
Goose!
I think we should go.
Trouble with your car, miss? I can give you two a lift if you like.
Jonathan.
You sure you don't need that ride?
Hello?
Leave it open.
Where the hell have you been?
I overslept. What the hell's going on? It's freezing.
Hey! Knock, knock.
We have a visitor.
So this thing, this shadow thing.
You told your mom it likes it like this. It likes it cold?
Yeah.
How do you know that?
I just know.
Does he talk to you?
No. It's like...
I don't have to think.
I just know things now.
Things I never did before.
And, uh...
what else do you know?
It's hard to explain.
It's like old memories in the back of my head,
only... they're not my memories.
Okay.
I mean, I don't think they're old memories at all. They're...
they're nowmemories, happening all at once, now.
Can you describe these nowmemories?
I don't know. It's... it's hard to explain.
I know it's hard but can you just... Can you try?
For us?
It's like...
They're growing and spreading...
killing.
The memories?
I don't know.
Oh!
I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's okay, sweetie.
Hey, hey, sweetie...
what if you didn't have to use words?
Hey, you've reached the Byers. We're sorry...
Anything?
We need to talk. AV room. Right now.
Party members only.
Come on, Mike.
No! This is nonnegotiable.
Sorry, Max. Sorry.
Will didn't want me to tell anyone,
but on Halloween night he saw a sort of shadow in the sky.
A shadow?
What kind of shadow?
I don't know. But it scared him.
And if Will really has True Sight...
I mean, if he can really see into the Upside Down,
maybe he saw that shadow again yesterday.
So that's why he was frozen like that? Maybe.
Can it hurt him?
I mean, if this shadow thing isn't from our world...
I'm not sure. Dustin?
Well, if you're in another plane,
you can't interact with the material plane,
so theoretically, no, the shadow can't hurt him.
Yeah, if that's even what's happening.
This isn't D & D. This is real life.
So what do we do?
We acquire more knowledge.
I'll go to Will's after school. See what's going on.
You guys stay here and find Dart.
Dart? What's he gotta do with this?
Will heard him in the Upside Down.
I don't know how yet, but he's gotta be connected to all this.
He's gotta be.
If we find Dart, maybe we can solve this thing.
Maybe we can help Will.
Hey! Hey, assholes!
Let us out of here!
Oh!
Not very pleasant in here, is it?
Sorry about that. Hospitality's not our strong suit.
You know, scientists and all.
Yeah. Okay.
You up for a little walk?
I'm assuming you're behind me.
"""Men of science have made abundant mistakes of every kind."""
George Sarton said that.
You guys know who George Sarton is? Doesn't really matter.
The point is, mistakes have been made. Yes.
Mistakes? Yes.
You killed Barbara.
Abundant mistakes, but, the men involved with those mistakes,
the ones responsible for what happened to your brother and Miss Holland's death,
they're gone. They're gone, and for better for worse,
I'm the schmuck they brought in to make things better.
But I can't make things better without your help.
You mean without us shutting up?
She's tough, this one. You guys been together long?
We're not together. Wanna see what really killed your friend?
Teddy, I brought you an audience today. I hope you don't mind.
More the merrier, sir.
I'd call it one hell of a mistake.
Wouldn't you?
See, the thing is, we can't seem to erase our mistake...
but we can stop it from spreading.
Like, it's like pulling weeds.
But imagine for a moment if a foreign state,
let's say, the Soviets... If they heard about our mistake...
do you think they would even consider that a mistake?
What if they tried to replicate that?
The more attention we bring to ourselves, the more...
the more people like the Hollands know the truth,
the more likely that scenario becomes.
You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too.
Just, same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.
So, we understand each other now, don't we?
This is more of the same.
Oh, it's nothing. It's just scribbles.
Wait!
What? What? Wait.
Wait. These black lines, see? What?
Look, they connect.
They connect.
Does this mean anything to you?
No.
I mean, is it some sort of maze or a road?
I mean, it's sort of forking and branching like... like lightning.
You think it's that storm?
No, the storm he drew was completely different. He used red.
And this is all blue and it has some weird dirt color.
I mean, maybe it's roots.
'Cause remember, he was saying it was spreading and
Killing.
He said they were killing.
Vines.
He's drawing vines.
Hey, Max. Have you seen Dustin? We're supposed to meet after class.
Max!
Hey, Max! Hey, where you going? Come on! We've gotta go look for Dart.
Yeah, good luck with that.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with me? What's wrong with you?
I don't understand. No! I don't understand!
You guys act like you want me to be your friend
but then you treat me like garbage!
That's not true! Yes, it is!
You go and hide in the AV Club,
keeping secrets like we're in second grade or something.
You know, I thought you guys wanted me in your party.
We do. But it's... But what?
There... there are just things.
Things we can't tell you, all right? For your own safety.
My own safety? Yes!
Because I'm a girl? What? No!
Did you keep secrets from El?
How do you know about El?
Did you?
That was different. Trust me. Okay?
That was just... just different.
Okay. You know what? Forget it, okay?
I don't wanna be in your stupid party anyway. I'm out.
Have a nice life.
Max! You still stink, by the way!
Oh, shit!
That kid you were talking to, who is he?
He's no one.
No one? This kid from my class.
Why was he talking to you?
It was just about a stupid class assignment.
Then why're you so upset? I'm not!
He causing you trouble?
Why do you care?
Because, Max, you're a piece of shit,
but we're family now whether we like it or not,
meaning I'm stuck looking out for you.
What would I ever do without Hey!
This is serious shit, okay?
I'm older than you.
And something you learn
is that there are a certain type of people in this world that you stay away from,
and that kid, Max...
That kid is one of them.
You stay away from him, you hear me?
Stay away.

Mrs. Byers?
Hey. Hey, Mike.
Is Will here? You know what?
Now is not a really good time.
Is he okay?
Yeah. You know, he's... he's just not feeling real well.
He's laying down, so I'll tell him you stopped by, okay?
It's about the shadow monster, isn't it?
Have a nice day.
Doesn't really matter. The point is, mistakes have been made.
Yes. Mistakes?
The men involved with those mistakes,
the ones responsible for what happened to your brother
and Miss Holland's death, they're gone...
...the ones responsible for what happened to your brother

You still wanna do this?
Let's burn that lab to the ground.
Mewmew, dinner!
Where are you? Mewmew!
Hey, Dusty! Hi, hey. Hey, Mom.
Everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Yeah.
Dart, I've gotta talk to you, buddy.
It's about my friend, Will.
I think...
What the hell?
Dart?
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, you reached Jim.
I'm probably doing something incredible right now, and I can't
It's like... It's like I feel what the shadow monster's feeling.
See what he's seeing.
Like in the Upside Down?
Some of him is there.
But some of him is here, too.
Here, like, in this house? In this house and...
in me.
It's like... It's like he's reaching into Hawkins more and more.
And the more he spreads, the more connected to him I feel.
And the more you see these nowmemories.
At first I just felt it in the back of my head.
I didn't even really know it was there.
It's like when you have a dream
and you can't remember it unless you think really hard.
It was like that.
But know it's like...
Now I remember. I remember all the time.
Maybe...
Maybe that's good. Good?
Just think about it, Will.
You're like a spy now. A superspy.
Spying on the shadow monster.
If you know what he's seeing and feeling...
maybe that's how we can stop him.
Maybe all of this is happening for a reason.
You really think so? Yeah. Yeah, I really do.
What if he figures out we're spying on him?
What if he spies back? He won't.
How do you know?
We won't let him.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Hey. Hey. Did you get 'em?
Yeah.
We'd like a... uh, a room.
We got those.
You want a single or a double?
Double.
Nance...
Uh, on or off? Hmm.
What? Nothing. Just...
déjà vu.
Yeah.
Don't you think it's weird?
What?
How we only seem to hang out when the world's about to end?
It's not going to end.
Feels like it.
Still have yours?
Yeah. Mmm...
Yeah, mine's bigger.
Congratulations. Thanks.
What happened?
What do you mean?
To us?
After everything, you just...
disappeared.
Yeah, Will needed me.
And Steve...
I waited.
Yeah, like, only a month.
I want them off.
Will, what's wrong?
Mom?
Mom?
Mom? Yeah?
I saw him. You saw who, baby?
Hopper.
I think he's in trouble.
I think he's going to die.
Shit!
That's enough, Erica. Uhuh.
Dad? Mmmhmm?
When Mom's mad at you, how do you make her not mad?
Hmm. That's a great question. How do you, hon?
First, I apologize.
Then, I get your mother whatever she wants.
Even when she's wrong?
She's never wrong, son.
That's right.
Not hungry? Not really.
Where you goin'?
To hang out with Dustin.
Sorry.
Mews!
Mewsy!
Mews!
Mewsy!
Dusty, baby, you're sure she's not in your room?
Uhhuh.
If you'd like to make a call...
Thank you so much, Mr. McCorkle. Thank you so much.
You are a true lifesaver.
All right, this was great.
Thank you. All right. Have a good one.
Byebye, now. All right. You, too.
All right, great news.
They found her?
No. But they saw her wandering around Loch Nora.
How did the poor baby get all the way out there?
I don't know. Lost, I guess. But they're gonna look for her.
And I'll stay here, just in case they call again.
And you're gonna go help look? Yeah? Yeah?
Give me hug. Give me a hug. Go get her.
You're gonna find her. Okay.
We can find her. We can find her.
I love you.
I love you. I love you.
I love you. All right, go.
All right.
All right, Dart. Breakfast time.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
Come on. Come on, I know you're hungry.
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Shit!
I'm sorry. You ate my cat.
All right. I think this is it.
Fiveonefive Larrabee, right?
Yes.
Fivefifteen.
"All right, ""Fivefifteen."" Sure."
Thank you.
Hey.
You apologize to your mama, yeah? Huh?
Must be scared half to death.
How long's it been?
Long time.
Go away! I'm not interested!
Look, I don't want your Thin Mints, all right, kid?
Thin Mints? Or your religious mumbo jumbo.
Whatever you're selling, I ain't buying, okay?
I want to see Mama.
Name a way you occupy your time when you're having a boring day at work.
"Drink coffee. ""Drink coffee,"" said Mike."
Yeah! Five answers will beat it, Lynn.
Visit with other employees.
"""Visit with other employees."" Rainbow."

Are you positive this is the right place?
"""3833."" Yeah."
All right.
Look at the camera.
The camera. What camera?
Not the loudspeaker. Above you, to the right.
Nancy Wheeler. Jonathan Byers. You two are a long way from home.
Well...
I hope you didn't come all this way to tell me about the bear
in the Harrington kid's backyard.
I've heard that one already.
Take a look. Go ahead, don't be shy.
I followed up on 200 tips,
most bogus, but that's how these things always go, okay?
I know every last step Barbara took that day,
every last person she talked to.
The answer to what happened to your friend, it's up here somewhere.
I assure you that. I just gotta connect the right dots.
Timeline's wrong.
I'm sorry?
Your timeline is wrong.
And the girl with the buzzed hair, she's not Russian. She's from Hawkins Lab.
Her name was Eleven.
You might wanna sit down for this.
If you're not out in an hour
Walking home. Yeah, yeah, I know. Hey! Watch the attitude, shitbird.
Sorry about that, Road Warrior.
What happened?
Short circuit in the motherboard. A real bummer.
But fret not. I got another machine up and running in the back.
Hold these.
You better get me that date now, Sinclair.
I told you I would.
And keep things PG in here, all right?
What is this shit, stalker?
Sorry. I just needed a safe place.
A safe place to what? Be creepy?
Listen. I'm gonna tell you the truth about everything that happened last year.
But if anyone finds out, you could be arrested.
Possibly killed.
Killed? I need to know.
Do you accept the risk?
Oh, my God! This... this is so stupid. Do you accept the risk?
Yeah.
Sure. Fine.
I accept the risk.
Let's hear it.
Last year...
Will didn't get lost in the woods.
He got lost somewhere else.
Hey, is this where you saw him? Is this where you saw Hopper?
I think so. Yeah.
Okay.
Here!
Okay, so... so Hopper is here?
Yeah. Now we just need to find out where here is, right?
Right.
Did he say anything? I mean, before he left?
Uh, some... something about vines?
Hopper.
Surprise. I would've called, but you said not to clog up the line.
You know, I... We're fine, we don't need anything.
When I was sick as a kid, and I was sick all the time as a kid,
nothing made me feel better than focusing on these brain teasers.
Those are great. Ah...
I could teach him how to play.
You know, he's sleeping.
Okay.
I could wait with you?
Listen, it's just not a good time.
But, um, you know what? I'll call you, okay?
Thank you.
You sure? Yeah.
Well, have him call me. They don't call me Bob the Brain for nothing.
Bob!
That's my name.
Huh.
Hmm.
You drew all these yourself? Mmmhmm.
Why, exactly? I... I told you the rules.
No questions, okay? Yeah.
We... we just need you to help us figure out what...
Bob? Bob?
Over here.
Where... where this is.
That's the objective. Find the X.
Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?
Bob, no questions.
Okay.
Let me talk to you for a second. Hang on, guys.
Joyce, you can talk to me. You know that, right?
Yeah. What's the problem, exactly?
What's the problem?
Joyce, Will doesn't look well.
You don't look well.
What's going on?
Nothing. Nothing.
Is this an episode? Is this one of Will's episodes?
No. No! No.
I'm sorry. I just... I don't...
see how any of this is good for Will, or for you.
And even if I wanted to play along, I mean, how could I figure anything out
if I don't understand the context of the game?
Or... What?
What is it? I know that shape.
It's Lovers' Lake.
It's Lovers' Lake. I get it.
Okay, I get. That's Lake Jordan.
And if that's Lake Jordan, then you can probably find...
Yeah, that's, uh, Sattler's quarry.
And if you just follow it naturally...
it moves to...
the Eno River.
And there it is. That's the Eno, do you see it?
Okay, so the lines aren't roads.
But they act like roads.
And they act like roads 'cause when you follow 'em, you'll see...
they don't go over water.
And that's the giveaway. That's the giveaway. Ha!
Don't you get it? It's not a puzzle,
it's a map.
It's a map of Hawkins.
Right, Will?
Does anybody copy?
Look, if anybody copies, this is Jim Hopper, Hawkins' Chief...
Guys, this is Dustin again.
Does anyone copy? This is a code red. I repeat, a code red!
I really need someone to pick up here.
Hopper's MIA, and I've got a code red.
Code red!
All right, it's Dustin again.
Seriously, I have a code red.
Could you please shut up?
Erica? Erica, is Lucas there?
Where is he? Don’t know. Don't care.
Is he with Mike?
Like I said, I don't know and I don't care.
Please tell him it's super important. Please tell him that I have a code
Code red?
Yep, code red. Exactly. Mmmhmm.
I got a code for you instead.
It's called code shutyourmouth.
Erica?
I just need a little help understanding, sweetie, okay?
Can you tell me where you came from?
Where you've been all this time?
A policeman and a woman came looking for you last year.
Did they find you?
She won't get better...
will she?
They don't think so, no.
But she's not in any pain.
She's just stuck, they think.
Like in a dream.
A long dream.
A good dream?
I hope so.
Is it the same dream?
We don't know.
Sometimes she says different words.
But usually those.
She always believed that you were out there.
She always believed that you'd come home one day.
Home?
Yeah, home.
Pretty.
I can get you a real bed, and you can stay here with me
if you want.
How's that sound?
I wanna help you, but to really do that, I need you to talk to me, okay?
Doesn't have to be now. Doesn't have to be today.
But when you're ready.
Okay?
Okay.
Oh, yeah, that.
That happens sometimes.
Old house, bad wiring...
Or if you ask my crazy aunt Shirley, it's...
haunted.
Sweetie, really, it's just the wiring.
No.
It's Mama.
Sunflower. Rainbow.
Three to the right. Four to the left.
I don't understand.
Fourfifty.
She knows I'm here.
She wants to talk.
Rainbow.
All right.
All right. I'm 3.6 inches, what do you got?
I'm not sure. Mrs. Byers?
Hold on.
Twentyone feet, four inches. What about Tippecanoe to Danford Creek?
Danford? Where's Danford?
Dining room.
Sixteen feet, ten inches.
What about Danford to Jordan?
Oh, come on. This has gotta be enough.
It's not. It's... it's really not.
Okay. Can't you figure it out?
Well, it's hard. The ratio isn't exactly onetoone.
I mean, if you're twisting my arm, and you are twisting my arm,
I would say that the X is...
maybe a half mile southeast of Danford?
Thank you. Thank you.
What? Are we... we really going?
I don't know, Cath.
Maybe if it was Margaret Thatcher, that'd be another story.
Just a second, Cath.
Ted, can you get that please?
Sorry.
I got it.
Your line has been busy for over two hours, Mr. Wheeler.
Do you realize this? Oh, I do realize.
Is Mike home? No.
No? Well, where the hell is he?
Karen, where's our son?
Will's!
Will's. No one's picking up there.
Nancy. What about Nancy?
Karen, where's Nancy?
Ally's! Ally's.
Our children don't live here anymore. You didn't know that?
Seriously? Am I done here?
Son of a bitch. You're really no help at all, you know that?
Hey! Language.
Listen...
I've been thinking...
I love you. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry? What the hell am I sorry for?
Steve.
Are those for Mr. or Mrs. Wheeler?
No. Good.
Hey. What the hell? Hey! Nancy isn't home.
Where is she? Doesn't matter.
We have bigger problems than your love life.
Do you still have that bat?
Bat? What bat? The one with the nails?
Why? I'll explain it on the way.
Now? Now!
Son of a bitch!
Wait. Wait. No, no! No! No!
And that was the last we ever saw of her.
After that, she was just gone.
I can't believe it's been that long. Feels like yesterday.
Yeah. I mean, I bet.
Wow. It's crazy.
I know.
It's crazy, but...
I really liked it.
Liked it? Yeah.
Well, I mean, I had a few issues. Issues?
I felt it was a little derivative in parts.
What are you talking about?
I just wish it had a little more originality.
That's all. You don't believe me?
Lucas, come on, seriously? How gullible do you think I am?
Why would I make this up?
I don't know. To impress me or something? Or you're just, like, insane.
I tell you all of this. I mean, topsecret stuff.
Risking my life. And this is how you react?
Risking your life?
Oh, so this is funny to you? Yeah. I mean...
kind of funny.
Stupid, but funny.
Where are you going?
Story time's over, isn't it?
What's wrong with you? I gave you what you wanted.
I wanted to be a part of the group, not a part of some joke.
It's not a joke.
You did a good job, okay?
You can go tell the others I believed your lies
if it gets you experience points or whatever.
We have a lot of rules in our party,
"but the most important is, ""Friends don't lie."""
Never ever. No matter what.
Is that right?
Then how do you explain this?
I had to do that. To protect you.
To protect me from who, exactly?
The big bad government baddies from Hawkins Lab?
Lower your voice.
Maybe it was to protect me from the Demogorgon from another dimension?
Max, I'm serious, shut up! Oh, no, no!
You know what it was? It was Eleven. The girl
Stop talking.
You're going to get us killed.
Do you understand?
You're serious?
I really wish I wasn't.
Prove it.
I can't.
So what? I'm supposed to just trust you?
Yes.
Shit. I gotta go. Um...
Don't follow me out. Okay?
Do you believe me?
The hell I tell you?
I'm not late.
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh, Lucas?
So he has a name now, huh?
It's a small town, okay? We weren't hanging out.
Hmm. Well, you know what happens when you lie.
I'm not lying.
What if they try to replicate that?
The more attention we bring to ourselves,
the more people like the Hollands who know the truth,
the more likely that scenario becomes.
You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too.
Just the same as those weeds there. By whatever means necessary.
So, is it enough?
The tape recording, is it enough? Is it incriminating?
What are you doing? Thinking.
With vodka?
It's a central nervous system depressant. So yes, with vodka.
Music? Really?
Yes. It helps me...
What? Think?
How long is this gonna take?
Longer if you keep talking.
Is the tape incriminating or not? It's a simple question.
There's nothing simple about it.
Nothing simple about anything you've told me.
You don't believe us, do you?
I believe you, but that's not the problem.
You don't need me to believe you. You need them to believe you.
Them? Them.
"With a capital ""T."""
Your priest, your postman, your teacher, the world at large.
They won't believe any of this.
That's why we made the tape.
Oh. That's easy to bury. Easy.
He admits it. You heard it. He admits culpability.
You're being naive, Nancy!
Those people...
They're not wired like me and you, okay?
They don't spend their lives trying to get a look at what's behind the curtain.
They like the curtain.
It provides them stability, comfort, definition.
This...
this would open the curtain,
and open the curtain behind that curtain, okay?
So the minute someone with an ounce of authority calls bullshit,
"everyone will nod their heads and say, ""See? Ha! I knew it! It was bullshit."""
That is, if you even get their attention at all.
You're saying we did all of this for nothing?
I'm saying, I'm thinking.
Ooh!
This is ridiculous.
That's it. That's it! What's it?
It's just too strong. Too strong.
Better.
Perfect.
We water it down.
Precisely. Wait. What?
Your story. We moderate it.
Just like this drink here.
We make it more tolerable.
Perhaps Barbara was exposed to some dangerous toxins.
A leak from the lab. Like Three Mile Island or something.
Something scary but familiar.
Close enough that it hits the man right where it hurts.
And those assholes that killed Barb...
They'll go down.
All right, what are we looking at?
This was some of the soil we took yesterday.
Okay. So what is your concern?
Well, we didn't find any signs of contamination.
Uh, nothing hazardous other than some pesticides.
Well, it's a farm.
Right, right. Exactly. But...
Like this?
Yes.
It's okay if I sit here, right?
Yes.
And I won't mess it up or anything?
No. Okay.
If you talk to Terry, will you tell her that I love her very much?
And that I'm sorry that I didn't believe
Stop talking. Okay, sorry.

I'm home.
No.
Mama!
Mama! Mama!
Oh, my baby! What do I do?
Mama, what do I do? Help me! Breathe. Breathe.
Just breathe. Breathe. Just breathe, all right?
They're on their way.
They're on their way, okay? Okay.
Stay with us, darling. Stay with us.
Hey, there.
Jane?
Where's Jane? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
No, I saw her.
No, no, she wasn't breathing. She was crying.
No. I heard it. He was there.
Who was there? He took her.
Don't take it out! Terry!
Terry! No! No!
Please don't!
Three to the right. Four to the left.
Ma'am, can I see your badge?
Stay back. Stay back!
Jane? Jane?
Jane... No!
No! No! She's my child! No!
She's my child!
No! No.
No.
No. No. No.
Ah!
Fourfifty.
Breathe. They're on their way.
Stay with us, darling.

There's nothing. There's nothing here.
Are... Are we close? We're in the vicinity.
What's that mean, the vicinity?
It means we're close. I don't know. It's not precise.
But we did all that work.
I told you, the scale ratio is not exactly onetoone. We needed to take
Turn right. What?
I saw him. Where?
Not here. In my nowmemories.
In your what? Turn right!
Are you okay?
Superspy.
What's Jim doing here? Joyce?
Boys, I need you to stay here. No. Mom, Mom, Mom, it's not safe.
That's why I need you to stay here! Stay here!
Hopper!
Hey, be careful.
Just going down the hole.
Vines.
Give me that.
The shovel? Yes, give me the shovel.
I need you to help me get down there.
Joyce, what are you talking about? Bob! Now!
Hopper!
Hopper!
Hopper!
Joyce, what is going on? Where are we? Bob, are you okay?
Tunnels. Is this Will's map?
Hopper!
Are we in Will's map?
Hopper! Hopper!
We're in Will's map.
Hopper!
We're actually inside of Will's map.
Hopper!
How did he know all this?
Bob!
Over here!
It's his.
He's gotta be this way.
Come on.
Hopper!
Do you see anything? I mean, in your nowmemories?
Hopper!
Hopper!
What?
This is...
Oh! It's his arm.
It's choking him.
Knife.
Knife? It's over there.
Okay.
Hands!
Hands!
Cut it...
Bastard!
Oh, my God. Hopper, are you okay?
Joyce. Are you okay? Are you okay?
Hey, Bob. Hey, Jim.
Oh, God!
Go! Go! Go! Clear the area!
Go! Wait.
Move, now!
Will? Will, you okay?
Will, what's wrong?
Get him out. Go! Go!
God! Hold on, sweetie!
I'm right here. Just hold on.
Vitals? Heart rate 220. Temperature's 106.
Will, where does it hurt?
All over.
She says he feels like he's burning. Check for burns.
I don't see anything.
Where does it hurt the most, Will? Everywhere! Everywhere!
♪ Here we stand or here we fall ♪
♪ History won't care at all ♪
Wait a sec. How big?
First it was like that. Now he's like this.
I swear to God, man, it's just some little lizard, okay?
It's not a lizard. How do you know?
How do I know if it's not? How do you know it's not just a lizard?
Because his face opened up and he ate my cat.
♪ We're just waiting For the hammer to fall ♪
♪ While you're waiting For the hammer to fall ♪
I don't hear shit.
He's in there.
All right, listen, kid. I swear, if this is some sort of Halloween prank,
you're dead. It's not.
All right? It's not a prank.
Get it out of my face.
You got a key for this thing?
Let me see that.
He must be further down there.
I'll stay up here in case he tries to escape.
Steve?
Steve, what's going on down there?
Get down here.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!
No way.
No way.
That thing, it... it did something to him.
Okay. And these nowmemories, as you call them,
how long has he been experiencing them?
I told you, since Thursday. Since I found him in the field.
And why wasn't he brought in?
I have been bringing him in, and what have you done?
Nothing. Nothing!
These are new symptoms, Joyce.
No. No, he has been telling you over and over that something's wrong,
and you said it was all in his head.
"You said, ""Be patient."" Those were your words."
I understand that you're upset, okay? I get it.
I would be, too, if I were in your shoes.
But we are all in the same boat here, and I just need you to try
What? Stay calm? Trust you?
No, I want him transferred to a real hospital.
Well, you know that's not possible.
He really will get the best treatment here, Mrs. Byers.
The very best.
And what are you treating him for, exactly?
Can anyone tell me what's wrong with him?
Can a single person in this room tell me what is wrong with my boy?
What is wrong with my boy?
You see why I have to stop the truth from spreading, too.
Just the same as those weeds there.
By whatever means necessary.
Whoohoo!
To taking down the man. To taking down the man.
Commie bastards sure know how to make a spirit. Am I right?
Oh, no, no, no. We... we can't. Yeah, no. No, I've got to drive.
Drive? What, tonight?
Our parents...
Would be proud if they knew what you were up to.
Just tell 'em you're at Tammy's or Dawn's or whoever's,
and take my guest room.
I mean, do... do you want to stay? Well, it is pretty late.
Okay. Uh... Could I use the sofa?
Okay, I'm confused. What's going on here? A lovers' quarrel?
No, no. I mean, we're just friends. Friends.
You've told me a lot of shockers today, but that, that is the first lie.
It's not a lie. No?
You're young, attractive.
You've got chemistry, history, plus the real shit, shared trauma.
Trust issues, am I right?
Something to do with your dad.
What? No, I mean, my dad's An asshole.
Hmm. It is a curse to see so clearly.
You, you're harder to read.
Probably, like everyone,
afraid of what would happen if you accepted yourself for who you really are
and retreated back to the safety of...
Name? Name? Steve.
Oh. Steve. We like Steve.
Yes.
But we don't love Steve. What?
No, we... I mean, I do.
There it is, ladies and germs, the second lie of the evening.
So, how'd I do?
My goodness. You two are adorable, aren't you?
Listen...
...there's a pullout sofa in my study if you want it.
But if I were you,
I'd cut the bullshit and share the damn bed.
Afraid.
Trust issues?
Trust issues.
Retreat?
I don't retreat.
Trust issues? I do not...
Oh. Hey.
Hey.
I just, uh...
I... I just wanted to say that...
Oh, no, don't I mean He's so drunk.
Wasted. Yeah.
I mean, what? He knows us for a couple of hours, and he's got us all figured out?
Exactly.
God. Okay, yeah. I feel... I'm glad we feel the same way.
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine.
Uh...
So, uh, good night, I guess.
Yeah, um, good night.
Oh, HeMan, thank you for saving my life. What strong muscles you have.
I knew it. Hey! They're in love!
No, actually, they're not. They don't even exist on the same planet.
Aren't you too old to be playing with toys?
That... that's not the point. The point is to stay out of my room.
Then tell your little nerdy friend to shut his mouth.
What are you talking about?
"""Code red, Lucas. Code red. Code red."""
Bunch of nerds.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Dustin!
This is Lucas. Do you copy? Dustin?
Well, well, well, look who it is. Sorry, man.
My stupid sister turned it off.
Well, when you were having sister problems, Dart grew again,
he escaped, and I'm pretty sure he's a baby Demogorgon.
Wait. What? I'll explain later.
Meet me and Steve at the old junkyard. Steve?
And bring your binoculars and wrist rocket.
Steve Harrington?
All right, let's go.
Just be there, stat. Over and out.
All right, cowboy, good news.
We're giving you the green light.
How you feeling?
Never better.
All right, well, got a present for ya.
The hell is that? Uh, something you should see.
Watch your step.
All living organisms develop defense mechanisms against attack.
They adapt. They find some way to survive.
Oh, my God.
It's pretty impressive, isn't it?
It's been spreading,
growing beneath us like some cancer.
Why aren't you burning it? There's a complication.
They made me sign, like, a thousand documents.
I mean... we all had to. We had to.
I mean, I lost track at a certain point.
They're gonna make you do the same. I'm sure.
Yeah. Well, hey, whatever.
What kind of documents?
Uh, confidentiality,
and there were these official forms saying, like, nothing ever happened,
which is why...
Will got lost in the woods.
Yeah.
Man, I always thought stuff like this happened in movies and comic books.
Certainly not in Hawkins, and certainly not to someone like you.
Or you. Yeah.
Bob Newby, superhero.
You cold?
Uh, just a little jitters, I guess.
Hey, don't you start worrying about me.
Okay. Okay? I'm fine.
I'm fine.
"It's not like you didn't warn me. ""This is not a normal family."""
Isn't that what you said? Yeah.
You weren't kidding.
It kinda makes my idea of moving to Maine sound a little less crazy, right?
Oh, it... it's not crazy at all.
Mom?
Hey.
Is there a doctor? We need a doctor!
Sweetie, how you feeling? You okay? Okay, they're on their way.
Hey.
Who is that? What?
What? It's me, big guy. It's Bob.
Are you a...
doctor?
No. No, it's just me. Just... just Bob.
So, Jonathan, how was the pullout?
Uh, sorry?
The sofa.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was good.
I bet.
Oops.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we just, um...
We just had some fun girl time.
Will you be back for dinner? Mmmhmm.
Yeah, I'll be home real soon. Say hey to Ally for me.
Okay. All right. I love you, too, Mom. Bye.
She said Mike's at your brother's house. They just had a sleepover. So...
Oh, okay.
Do you wanna try again?
No. No, it's fine. They're probably just at the matinée or something.
Yeah, I'm sure.
For your travels.
And to water it down.
Got it.
Thank you for everything.
Don't thank me yet. Just keep your eyes on the papers, hmm?
And if you need to reach me again...
don't.
Twentyone.
Twentytwo.
Max, are you getting that or what? Okay!
Swear to God, Max!
What are you doing here?
I have proof. What?
Proof that what I told you was real. But we have to hurry.
What kind of proof?
Who the hell were you talking to?
Mormons.
Mormons?
Talkative ones.
Come on, hop on.
Hurry.
This better be good, stalker.
Do you know your name?
Will.
Your full name? William Byers.
Do you know... Do you know who I am?
A doctor.
Have we met before?
I don't remember. Hmm.
You don't remember me?
Okay.
How about, uh... How about this guy here?
Know who that is?
It's all right. Take your time.
That's my friend.
Mike.
What about me, kid? You remember me?
They tell me you helped save me last night. You remember that?
Do you remember anything about last night? About what happened?
I remember they hurt me.
You mean the doctors?
No. The soldiers.
The soldiers hurt you?
They shouldn't have done that.
It upset him.
"You say, ""Upset him."" Is that him?"
Okay. Okay, I wanna try something.
It's gonna seem a little odd at first,
but I think it's really gonna help us understand what's going on.
Is that okay?
Okay.
Now, Will, I want you to just let us know if you feel anything. Okay?
Do you feel anything? Little sting.
It stings? Where?
My chest.
Okay, son. Sweetie...
How about now? It... it burns.
Ah!
It burns. Where?
Everywhere.
That's enough. That's enough!
Stop! You heard her! That's enough!
That's it! We're done!
Okay.
Sweetie... Sweetie. It's okay.
Our best guess right now is it's some kind of virus
which is causing this neurological disorder.
Now, when... when a typical virus attaches itself to its host...
...it duplicates, right? It spreads, essentially hijacking the host.
A virus is alive. It has an intelligence.
That's not... That's not unusual.
What is so unusual here,
this virus... the infected hosts seem to be communicating.
It has some sort of a hive intelligence, and it's connecting all the hosts.
The good news is a virus can be cured.
We... we're gonna continue to run tests.
We're gonna see what we find.
What happens when he can't remember anything?
When there's nothing else there?
What happens when my boy is gone?
All right, so let me get this straight.
You kept something you knew was probably dangerous
in order to impress a girl who... who you just met?
All right, that's grossly oversimplifying things.
I mean, why would a girl like some nasty slug anyway?
An interdimensional slug? Because it's awesome.
Well, even if she thought it was cool, which she didn't, I... I just...
I don't know. I just feel like you're trying way too hard.
Well, not everyone can have your perfect hair, all right?
It's not about the hair, man.
The key with girls is just... just acting like you don't care.
Even if you do? Yeah, exactly. It drives them nuts.
Then what? You just wait until, uh...
until you feel it. Feel what?
It's like before it's gonna storm, you know?
You can't see it, but you can feel it, like this, uh...
electricity, you know?
Oh, like in the electromagnetic field when the clouds in the atmosphere
No, no, no, no, no. Like a... Like a sexual electricity.
Oh.
You feel that and then you make your move.
So that's when you kiss her?
No, whoa, whoa. Slow down, Romeo. Sorry.
Sure, okay, some girls, yeah, they want you to be aggressive.
You know, strong, hot and heavy, like a...
I don't know, like a lion. Mmm.
But others, you gotta be slow, you gotta be stealthy, like a...
like a ninja.
What type is Nancy?
Nancy's different. She's different than the other girls.
Yeah, she seems pretty special, I guess.
Yeah. Yeah, she is.
But this girl's special, too, you know. It's just, like, something about her.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey. What?
You're not falling in love with this girl, are you?
Uh, no. No.
Okay, good. Don't. I won't.
She's only gonna break your heart, and you're way too young for that shit.
Fabergé.
What?
It's Fabergé Organics.
Use the shampoo and conditioner, and when your hair's damp...
It's not wet, okay?
When it's damp... Damp.
You do four puffs of the Farrah Fawcett spray.
Farrah Fawcett spray? Yeah, Farrah Fawcett.
You tell anyone I just told you that and your ass is grass.
You're dead, Henderson. Do you understand?
Yup.
Okay.
Farrah Fawcett, really? I mean, she's hot.
Yeah.
Hey, it's, uh...
It's me.
I know that I've been gone too long, and, uh...
It's I just, I want you to know that it's not about you
and it's not about our fight.
Okay?
Something came up, and I will... I will explain it all when I see you.
I just ... I want you to know that I'm not mad.
I'm just sorry.
About everything.
I...
I don't want you to get hurt at all.
And I don't wanna lose you.
Just make sure you heat up some real food. Not just Eggos.
And I want you to eat all the peas, even if they're mushy and gross. And...
I will be home soon.
This is him last week.
And there are the hippocampal abnormalities we had discussed.
Nothing out of line with what we've seen
from others suffering from posttraumatic stress. But...
this is Will from last night.
And as you can see,
there are now abnormalities in the limbic and paralimbic areas.
And this...
is from an hour ago.
I don't hear any suggestions. We have bigger problems than the boy.
Do we? We can't keep delaying the burn.
You're talking about putting... putting a BandAid on this.
Right now, a BandAid is the best option. It's our only option.
And if it kills the boy? Then quite frankly, Sam, it kills him.
Say that to me again.
The rate this is spreading, he'll be lost by the end of the day.
What we do or don't do won't change the outcome.
We have to start the burn.
Where you going?
I'm going to think.
What the hell is taking so long?
Hey... doctors take forever, always. Just try and relax. Just be patient.
You know, I just...
Let me through. Let me through!
You know we can't do that. I need to talk to
He'll be with you shortly. You said that an hour ago.
Will.
Will? Will?
What's wrong? Are you hurting again?
Uh...
I saw something.
In your nowmemories?
The shadow monster.
I think I know how to stop him.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will do.
This will do just fine.
Good call, dude.
I said mediumwell!
Who's that?
You told her?
"So what? ""So what?"""
You wanted to tell her, too. But I didn't, all right?
We agreed not to tell her and to look for Dart.
Who you conveniently found. Are you suggesting that I'm lying?
I'm saying you have a creepy little bond with him.
Yeah, that was before he turned into a Demogorgon.
And you haven't heard from Mike? No.
Or Will? No.
Hopper? No! No one is around.
Why do you think I'm with Steve Harrington?
Something's Wrong. I agree.
Which is why we need as much help as we can get.
She didn't believe me anyway.
You probably didn't tell it right.
That must be it.
So, we good?
Hey! Dickheads! How come the only one helping me out is this random girl?
We lose light in 40 minutes. Let's go. Let's go, I said!
All right, asshole! God! Okay! Stupid.
What...
What is all of this?
I don't know.
Mom?
Will?
I don't shoot Polaroid.
What? It's not mine.
Someone else has been here.
Sam, this is ludicrous.
Just give him a moment, okay? We don't have time
Hey, jackass, why don't you do us all a favor and shut up, okay?
That's it.
That's what? What... what's there, Will?
I don't know.
I just know he doesn't want me to see there.
I think it's important.
Let's see if this kid's a wizard or schizo, Doc.
First door on your right, gentlemen.
I'm guessing a ten. Let's not overdo it now.
I read four.
Moving in.
So you really fought one of these things before?
And you're, like, totally, 100% sure it wasn't a bear?
Shit. Don't be an idiot. Okay? It wasn't a bear.
Why are you even here if you don't believe us?
Just go home.
Geesh. Someone's cranky. Past your bedtime?
That's good. Just show her you don't care.
I don't.
Why are you winking, Steve? Stop.
It's kinda awesome. Huh?
The fog, I mean.
Looks like the ocean.
You miss it? What?
The ocean. The waves? California?
Hawkins seems pretty lame, I bet. No, no, no, it's not that. It's just...
My dad's still there. So...
"Why? It's this legal term called ""divorce."""
See, when two married people don't love each other anymore
Yeah.
My mom and my stepdad,
they wanted a fresh start away from him.
As if... As if he was the problem, which is total bull.
And things...
are just worse now.
My stepbrother's always been a dick,
but now he's just angry... all the time and...
Well, he can't take it out on my mom, so...
So he takes it out on you?
I don't even know why I'm telling you this.
It's just... I know that I can be a jerk like him sometimes,
and I do not want to be like him. Ever.
I guess I'm angry, too, and...
I'm sorry.
Jesus! What's wrong with me?
Hey. You're nothing like your brother, okay?
You're cool and different. And you're super smart.
And you're, like, totally tubular.
Nobody actually says that, you know. Well, I do now.
And it makes you seem really cool.
I like talking with you, Mad Max.
And I like talking with you, stalker.
You see him? No.
Lucas, what's going on?
Hold on!
I've got eyes! Ten o'clock! Ten o'clock!
There.
What's he doing? I don't know.
Wait. You sure that's not a dog? What?
He's not taking the bait. Why is he not taking the bait?
Maybe he's not hungry?
Maybe he's sick of cow.
Steve? Steve, what are you doing?
Steve?
Just get ready.
Come on, buddy.
What's he doing? Expanding the menu.
Come on, buddy.
Come on, buddy.
Come on. Dinner time.
Human tastes better than cat, I promise.
He's insane.
He's awesome.
Steve, watch out!
A little busy here!
Three o'clock! Three o'clock!
Steve!
Steve! Abort! Abort!
Steve, run! Steve, hurry!
Steve, run!
Shit!
Are they rabid or something?
They can't get in! They can't!
Shit!
Is anyone there? Mike? Will? God! Anyone!
Shit!
We're at the old junkyard, and we are going to die!
Out of the way! Out of the way! You want some? Come get this!
Jeez.
What happened?
I don't know.
Steve scared 'em off? No.
No way.
They're going somewhere.
Almost there, ladies. Roger.
All right, stay frosty, boys.
Wait. That's where I was. What?
It's that damn graveyard.
Sir, there's nothing here.
Looks like your kid's full of shit, Doc.
Got some kind of fog moving in now.
I'm sorry.
What? What do you mean, sweetie?
He made me do it.
Who? Who made you do what?
I told you.
They upset him.
They shouldn't have done that.
They shouldn't have upset him.
The spy.
The spy!
We've got movement.
You've got company, fellas.
Whoa, whoa!
I need to get through! It's a trap!
It's a trap! I need to warn them. It's a trap!
I can't see shit! Where are they? Where are they?
They're right on you!
Wait, what? What was that?
Will, sweets, talk to me. You got to help me understand.
It's too late.
You should go now.
They're almost here.
Mama? It's me. Jane.
I'm home.
No.
Breathe.
Sunflower.
Rainbow.
Fourfifty. Three to the right... Breathe.
Four to the left. Sunflower.
Fourfifty. Rainbow. Breathe.
Three to the right. Four to the left. Breathe.
Fourfifty. Sunflower. Rainbow.
Breathe. Sunflower. Rainbow.
Three to the right. Four to the left.
Okay. You okay?
And it just kept repeating?
Repeat?
Like a circle? Just showing you the same image over and over?
She kept showing the girl in the room.
The rainbow room?
What did the girl look like?
Different. Different than you?
I think this is why Mama wanted to talk.
To show you the girl?
I think she wants me to find her.
When Terry was looking for you,
she kept these files of other missing kids.
Kids she thought were like you.
Maybe that girl is in here somewhere.
Here.
Does anyone look familiar?
Is that her?
Did you find her?
No.
Hello?
Becky! Becky, I found her.
I just I didn't know who else to call.
He gave me this number, and he came here looking for her.
I thought maybe he could help me.
Yeah, Jim Hopper, he came here with some woman named Joyce Byers?
Well, that's a little hard to explain. Uh...
There's another girl, and she's missing, and I think she's in trouble.
I just I didn't know who to call.
Thank you, thank you. And you are?
Florence...
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Jane? Jane?
Jane?
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!

There aren't any cows to milk here, kid.
Go on back to the farm now.
I'm looking for my sister.
Aw... Shirley Temple lost her sister. So sad.
I saw her. Here.
Uhuh. Hand out of pocket. Slow.
Give me that shit.
Is that Kali? Kali?
How did you find us?
Who else knows you're here? No one.
So, what then? Poof! You just show up like magic with that picture?
Stay calm. She's just a kid.
A kid who could get us all killed.
If I have to ask again, Shirley, you'll start losing things.
Starting with those pretty little locks of yours. Yeah?
Come on, Axe. Put down the knife.
How did you find us?
I saw her. Axe!
That's not an answer.
Jesus. Jesus Christ!
Get off! Shit! Shit!
You're a terrible dancer, Axel.
I told you, stay out of my head.
So, we're threatening little girls now, are we?
She knows about you. She had this.
Where did you get this?
Mama.
Your mother gave this to you?
In her dream circle.
Dream circle. I think she's a schizo or something.
Says she's looking for her sister. Yeah. Like I said, schizo.
Jesus!
I saw you.
In the rainbow room.
What is your name?
Jane.
Sister.
Sister.
And this memory your mother shared...
that is your only memory of me?
Yes.
And how long have you been with this policeman?
Three hundred and twentyseven days.
And this policeman, he thinks
he can work out some sort of deal with these men to set you free?
Yes.
He says soon. He's naïve then.
We'll always be monsters to them. Do you understand?
Let me guess. Your policeman, he also stops you from using your gifts?
What you can do is incredible.
It makes you very special, Jane.
Wait.
Do you have a gift? Different.
I can make people see, or not see, whatever I choose.
Is that why you made the man with the crazy hair dance?
Axel is not so fond of spiders, so... You made him see spiders?
But it doesn't have to be scary.
This butterfly, it isn't real.
I've just convinced your mind it is.
Think of it as a kind of magic.
Are you real?
Yes, I'm real.
What's wrong?
Nothing is wrong.
I just feel... whole... now.
Like... a piece of me was missing,
and now it's not.
Does that make sense?
Yes.
I think your mother sent you here for a reason.
I think she somehow knew that we belong together.
I think this is your home.
Home.
Yes. Home.
This is car 13, responding to a 245 at 31 Ashbury.
...suspect under surveillance.
Shit.
How's your white hick sister? You tuck her in real tight?
Yeah, what about a lullaby? Did you sing her one?
♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪ Yeah.
♪ EIEIO ♪
♪ And on his farm he had a cow ♪
She found me with only this.
What's that mean?
It means she can find people without moving.
With nothing but an image.
You telling me Shirley's a human radar detector or some shit?
Or some shit, yes.
Come on. No way.
We'll find out soon enough.
I want to do one. Tomorrow.
You serious, Kal? We're way too hot right now.
Paranoid.
Realistic. You don't kill their men and expect them to look the other way.
If they find us, they will unleash hell.
So we give in to fear?
She's in pain. She needs this.
We go out tomorrow.
Swear to God, Shirley Temple's gonna get us all killed.
It's me.
I know that I've been gone too long, and, uh...
I just want you to know that it's not because of you.
And it's not because of our fight.
Something came up,
and, uh, I'll explain everything soon.
I just, um...
I want you to know that I'm not I'm not mad at you. I...
I'm just sorry.
It's okay. It's only me.
Bad dream?
What time is it?
It's late.
You slept well. Come.
It's time you meet my friends. Properly this time.
We need more money, Kal. I can't keep eating this garbage.
This is Axel. The spider hater?
Yes, the spider hater.
This is Dottie, our newest.
Like you, she just left home.
You mean the loony bin. Mick, our eyes, our protector.
This is Funshine, our warrior.
Don't let his size frighten you. Fun's a teddy bear.
Nice to meet you, Miss Jane.
If you're looking for a number, you won't find one.
They're not like us.
No, not in that way. But like us, they're outcasts.
Outcasts?
Freaks. Speak for yourself.
Society left them behind, hurt them, discarded them.
We were dead, all of us.
Kali saved us. Here. And here.
Don't get all mushy on us now, Fun.
No, not mushy. True.
Now we help her.
In this life, kid, you roll over or you fight back.
We're all fighters here.
Fight who?
Everyone you see here was in some way responsible
for what happened to us.
You hurt the bad men?
No, we just give 'em a pat on the back.
You kill them?
They're criminals. We simply make them pay for their crimes.
Boom.
Damn, Shirley. What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost.
We can't all be fighters, I guess.
I'm a fighter. I've killed.
These men you killed, did they deserve it?
They hurt me.
And they still want to hurt you. To hurt us.
We're just making the first move.
Come.
I was just like you once.
I kept my anger inside.
I tried to hide from it, but then that pain festered.
Festered?
It spread.
Until finally I confronted my pain, and I began to heal.
Do you see that train? Yes.
I want you to draw it to us.
I can't.
Last night you told me you lifted a van once.
Yes.
The bad men were trying to take you again,
and that made you angry.
Good. So, find that anger,
focus on that, not the train, not its weight.
I want you to find something from your life.
Something that angers you.
Now channel it.
Dig deeper. Your whole life you've been lied to...
Do I have a mother? She's not around anymore.
...imprisoned.
Don't walk away from me! Grow the hell up!
The bad men took away your home,
your mother...
Jane.
They took everything from you.
Papa!
They stole your life, Jane.
I want you to find them.
Yeah!
Yeah, Jane!
So, how do you feel?
Good.
These are the bad men, as you call them.
The one's we believe are still alive. Do you know any?
Him.
Fourfifty...
He hurt Mama.
His name is Ray Caroll. And he did more than hurt your mother.
The bad men like Ray, they know about us.
It's made them hard to track. But maybe not anymore.
"""Gramercy Apartments. Washington and Bethel."""
That's gotta be it. Right?
"""Lilburn."" Where is that? About an hour east."
We don't even have a new ride.
So we swap plates. We have plates, right?
Yeah. It's risky.
Where's the fun if there's no risk?
We want to give my sister a memorable first day, right?
I'm in. For Miss Jane.
Yeah, sure. Why not? Mick?
Screw it!
Bitchin'.
Bitchin'.
Get off me! Get off me!
What are we doing?
Stocking up.
Hey, your bathroom is leaking.
Oh, shit.
Yes.
Shit.
Okay, contestants, you have a minute and a half,
let's begin your supermarket sweep!
Hey! Put that back, or I'll blow your head off.
You hear me, freak? Put the gun down.
Stay back. Stay back.
Darrel, your money is insured.
We're only stealing from the war criminal billionaires who own this place.
You won't even lose a dime. I said stay back.
We're on the same side.
I promise. Stay back.
Damn, Shirley.
Let's go! Go! Go, go, go, go!
Mick! We gotta go, Mick!
We should case the place, stick to the routine. We have time.
We also have her. Can you look?
He's watching television. Is he alone?
I saw him. No one else.
Good enough for me. Me, too.
Let's do this.
Keep it running. Meet you around back.
Punky, what's the matter?
A nightmare.
I dreamt I was in the doctor's office.
All of a sudden, he's started to give me my shot in my arm.
Then the needle got bigger and bigger and bigger...
Hello, Ray.
Jesus Christ!
Sit down. Please.
I said sit. Please...
Just, please... just take what you want.
Oh, we will.
Where's your wallet?
Bedroom. My bedroom. My jeans. Come on.
Yes.
Got it.
Do you remember us?
What about us? Do you remember us, Ray?
Please. Please.
You hurt Mama.
Wait.
Please. Listen...
I just did what he told me to do.
He said she was sick.
You had a choice, Ray.
And you chose to follow a man you knew was evil.
No, wait! No, wait! Wait!
I can help. I can help you find him.
Find who? Brenner!
I can take you to him.
Papa is gone.
No, he is alive.
Do not lie to us, Ray.
I'm not lying!
I swear...
He trusts me.
I'll take you to him.
If he's alive, Jane will find him.
Just as she found you.
Do it, Jane.
Do it. Wait.
Not too quick.
He wasn't so generous with your mother.
Sweetie, just stay calm.
Oh, shit!
The police are on their way, honey. Okay?
What's wrong?
What's wrong? We got a problem.
Kids in the apartment.
Please...
Did he show your mother mercy? No. Please. No.
I'm sorry. He took her from you, without hesitation.
Please don't. Please.
We got to go, K. They called the cops.
We finish this first.
Kali! Jane, now!
Please, don't...
Please. Please.
Kali, we gotta go!
Shit! Go, go, go!
Shit!
Come on. Get in!
If you wanted to show mercy, that is your choice.
But don't you ever take away mine. Ever.
Do you understand? Do you understand?
I see you, and I raise you ten.
How ya like that?
That was a mistake right there, girl. A mistake.
I think you're full of shit.
May I sit?
I was once just like you, you know that?
But that's why I'm hard on you, because I see in you my past mistakes.
They were kids.
Does that excuse that man's sins? Were we not also children?
I remember the day I came to the rainbow room and you were gone.
So, when my gifts were strong enough, I used them to escape.
And I ran.
I ran away as far as I could.
And it was there, far away, that I found a place to hide.
A family.
A home.
Just like you and your policeman.
But they couldn't help me.
So, eventually, I lost them, too.
So, I decided to play the part.
To stop hiding.
To use my gifts against those who hurt us.
You're now faced with the same choice, Jane.
Go back into hiding and hope they don't find you.
Fight, and face them again.
Face who?
The man who calls himself our father.
Papa is dead.
That man tonight disagreed.
You're not real.
All this time? And you haven't looked for me?
Why?
Because you thought I was dead?
Or because you were afraid of what you might find?
Go away.
You have to confront your pain.
You have a wound, Eleven, a terrible wound.
And it's festering.
Do you remember what that means? Festering?
It means a rot.
And it will grow.
Spread.
Get out of my head. And eventually, it will kill you.
Get out of my head!
This isn't a prison, Jane.
You're always free to return to your policeman.
Or stay, and avenge your mother.
Let us heal our wounds together.
Full house. Screw this. I'm out.
Out of money, you mean. You are broke!
You want in, Mick? Nope.
Aw, come on! Just one hand. You're the worst.
How am I the worst?
Because, one hand leads to two hands,
two hands leads to three. Before you know it, I'm as broke as Axel.
Are you in or out? Out.
Today, tomorrow, the next day.
"Maybe we can call you ""El."" Short for Eleven."
You'd better run! She's our friend, and she's crazy!
No, El, you're not the monster.
You saved me, you understand? You saved me.
Compromise?
It's something that's kind of in between. Like halfway happy.
Once we fix it up, it's gonna be nice. Real nice.
This is your new home.
That's where I was. It's a damn graveyard.
I need to get through! I need to get through!
Whoa! Whoa! I need to warn them. It's a trap!
I need to get through. It's a trap. I need to tell them it's a trap.
Mike! It's a trap! It's a trap!
Mike!
Mike! Mike!
Mike! Mike, where are you?
Mike! Mike!
Go, go, go!
Let's go.
Don't move!
The hell's going on? They found us!
Jesus! Jesus Christ! No, no, no.
Shh...
Spread left. Right.
Let's go! Now!
Hey! Hey! Jane, come on!
Come on, hurry!
Look out! Look out!
Get down! Get down!
Do something, Kal. Do something!
Jane, get in.
It's a damn graveyard.
Mike! It's a trap! It's a trap!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I have to go back.
My friends... My friends are in danger.
This isn't time for a talk. We got to go right now!
Your mother sent you here for a reason, remember?
We belong together.
There's nothing for you back there. They cannot save you, Jane.
No.
But I can save them.
Jane. Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
The hell was that? What's wrong with her?
You all right, sweetie?
You were looking a little forlorn there. You mind if I join you?
Hmm.
You are awfully young to be traveling alone, aren't you?
Well, you are quite the chatterbox.
So, where are you headed?
To your parents, I hope?
I'm going to my friends.
I'm going home.
Mother of God.
It's... it's polycarbonate. It can't get through.
Mother Mary and Joseph.
You sure about that glass?
What the hell?
We're too late. What?
We're too late!
What's going on?
We're under attack.
What's going on down there? Does anybody copy?
Hurry!
Stairs! Stairs!
We need to make Will sleep.
What? He's a spy. If he knows where we are,
so does the shadow monster. He's lying!
He killed those soldiers. He'll kill us, too!
He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying! He's lying!
Shit!
Those are gunshots!
He's lying! He's lying!
Okay, Will, Will, listen, listen. Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?
You're...
You're... You're Mom.
Hold him down.
No! No! Let go! No! No! Let me go! Let go!
No, let me go! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Let me go! Let go! Let me go!
No! Let go! Let me go! Let me go!
We gotta go. We gotta go.
Come on!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hey, guys, we're home.
Guys?
Hello?
Max?
Billy?
Yeah, I'm a little bit busy in here, Susan.
Open the door. Right now.
What's wrong?
Why don't you tell us?
Because I don't know.
We can't find Maxine. And her window's open.
Where is she? I don't know.
You don't know?
Look, I'm sure she just, I don't know, went to the arcade or something.
I'm sure she's fine.
You were supposed to watch her.
I know, Dad. I was.
It's just you guys were three hours late, and, well, I have a date.
I'm sorry, okay?
That's why you've been staring at yourself in the mirror
like some faggot instead of watching your sister?
I have been looking after her all week, Dad. Okay?
She wants to run off, then that's her problem, all right?
She's 13 years old. She shouldn't need a fulltime babysitter.
And she's not my sister!
What did we talk about?
What did we... talk about?
Respect and responsibility.
That is right.
Now, apologize to Susan.
I'm sorry, Susan.
It's okay, Neil, really
No, it's not okay. Nothing about his behavior is okay.
But he's gonna make up for it.
He's gonna call whatever whore he's seeing tonight
and cancel their date.
And then he's gonna go find his sister.
Like the good, kind, respecting brother that he is.
Isn't that right, Billy?
Isn't that right?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.
Yes, sir.
Find Max.
You're positive that was Dart?
Yes. He had the same exact yellow pattern on his butt.
He was tiny two days ago. Well, he's molted three times already.
Malted? Molted.
Shed his skin to make room for growth like hornworms.
When's he gonna molt again? It's gotta be soon.
When he does, he'll be fully grown, or close to it.
And so will his friends.
Yeah, and he's gonna eat a lot more than just cats.
Wait, a cat?
Dart ate a cat? No, what? No.
What are you talking about? He ate Mews.
Mews? Who's Mews?
It's Dustin's cat. Steve!
I knew it! You kept him!
No!
No.
No, I... No, I...
He missed me. He wanted to come home.
Bullshit! I didn't know he was a Demogorgon, okay?
Oh, so now you admit it? Guys, who cares? We have to go.
I care! You put the party in jeopardy! You broke the rule of law!
So did you! What?
You told a stranger the truth!
A stranger?
You wanted to tell her, too!
But I didn't, Lucas, okay?
I didn't tell her!
We both broke the rule of law, okay? So we're even. We're even.
No, no! We're not even. Don't even try that.
Your stupid pet could have ate us for dinner!
That was not my fault! Guys?
He wasn't gonna eat us.
He was crawling to come say hello?
Guys!
No, no, no. Hey, guys, why are you headed towards the sound?
Hello?
Hello?
I don't see him.
It's the lab.
They were going back home.
Look, this is us, and this is the nearest exit.
But even if we somehow make it there, there's no way out.
What do you mean? The locks are fail secure.
Fail secure?
If there's a power outage, the building goes on lockdown.
Can it be unlocked remotely?
With a computer, sure, but somebody's gotta reset the breakers.
Where are the breakers? Breakers are in the basement,
three floors down.
Hey, where are you going?
To reset the breakers.
Okay, then what?
Then we get out of here. No, then the power comes back on.
If you wanna unlock the doors, you have to reboot the computer system,
and then override the security codes with a manual input.
Fine, how do I do that?
You can't. Not unless you know BASIC.
I don't know what that means.
It's a computer programming language. Teach it to me.
Shall I teach you French while I'm at it, Jim?
How about a little German?
How about you, Doc? You speak BASIC?
No.
Okay, I got this.
I got this.
No. Bob.
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay. Remember, Bob Newby, superhero.
Okay, grab his walkie.
All right, you know how to use one of these?
No.
Safety on. Safety off. Point. Squeeze.
Point and squeeze. Okay. Easypeasy.
If anything happens down there, I want you to come right back up.
Right back here. Listen.
Don't wait for me. As soon as I get those doors open...
I'm gonna get them out. Yeah?
I promise.
Okay, well... I'll be in touch.
Why are the lights off?
Maybe it's closed?
Security took the night off?
I don't think so.
It's not working?
No! The power's off.
Jonathan? What?
I think there's something in the woods.
Nancy, stay back.
Hello?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Steve?
Nancy? Jonathan.
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
We're looking for Mike and Will.
They're not in there, are they? We're not sure.
Why?
Keep it together, Bob.
Oh, God.
Okay, here we go.
He made it.
We haven't seen Will I haven't seen him since...
The power's back.
Let me try. Hang on
Let me try, Jonathan!
Son of a bitch! You know what...
Okay, Bob, can you hear us?
Loud and clear, Doc. Can you hear me back?
We hear you.
All right, give me a minute.
Open sesame.
It's open.
Okay.
Hey! I got it!
I got it!
Easypeasy.
Son of a bitch did it.
Right, I'll meet you outside.
Nice job.
Hold on a second, Chief. What's wrong?
West stairwell's not clear anymore.
What's going on? We've got some company.
Where? The west stairwell.
I got an idea.
What the hell's he doing?
Okay. And splash.
Okay. Okay, that worked.
Now, get out of there.
Go! Go!
Wait a second, Chief?
What? Take this.
What are you doing? Any more surprises, I'll let you know.
Go. Go!
Come on, Bob. Come on.
Hey, Bob?
Yeah?
I'm gonna guide you, okay? Is there a problem?
No, it's just... It's, uh, getting a little crowded up here,
so we're gonna have to take this slow.
Okay.
All right, just start walking.
Okay, good.
Okay, now, your next right.
Now, keep going, keep going, keep going...
Stop!
What?
What?
Bob, there's a door on your left, do you see that?
Yeah?
That's a closet. Okay?
Yeah, I need you to get in it. What?
Now! Right now. Get in the closet.
Jesus Christ.
Okay.
How you holding up there, Bob? You all right?
Yeah. Yeah.
You got a pretty clear shot to the front door.
Okay.
You can do this, okay?
You're almost home free, all right, Bob?
Run!
Bob!
Bob.
No!
No!
Go!
No!
Go!
Bob!
Bob!
No!
What happened? No!
No!
He's gone! He's gone!
Come on! Get in!
Guys?
Let's go.
Come on!
Come on, let's go! Let's go! Come on!
I'm sorry, bud.
Sorry I wasn't there. I should have been here.
Sam Owens. Dr. Sam Owens. How many people at the lab?
I don't know how many people are there!
I don't know how many people are left alive!
Have you contacted the police? I am the police! Chief Jim Hopper!
Is there a number I can reach you at?
Yes, the number that I gave you, yes.
Okay, yes, I got it.
I will be here. I'll have them contact you.
They didn't believe you, did they?
We'll see.
"""We'll see""? We can't just sit here while those things are loose!"
We stay here, and we wait for help.
Did you guys know that Bob was the original founder of Hawkins AV?
Really?
He petitioned the school to start it and everything.
Then he had a fundraiser for equipment.
Mr. Clarke learned everything from him.
Pretty awesome, right?
Yeah.
We can't let him die in vain.
What do you want to do, Mike?
The Chief's right on this.
We can't stop those Demodogs on our own.
Demodogs?
Demogorgon dogs.
Demodogs.
It's like a compound.
It's like a play on words
Okay.
I mean, when it was just Dart, maybe... But there's an army now.
Precisely. His army.
What do you mean?
His army.
Maybe if we stop him, we can stop his army, too.
The shadow monster. It got Will that day on the field.
The doctor said it was like a virus, it infected him.
And so this virus, it's connecting him to the tunnels?
To the tunnels, monsters, the Upside Down, everything.
Whoa. Slow down. Slow down.
Okay, so, the shadow monster's inside everything.
And if the vines feel something like pain, then so does Will.
And so does Dart. Yeah. Like what Mr. Clarke taught us.
The hive mind. Hive mind?
A collective consciousness. It's a superorganism.
And this is the thing that controls everything. It's the brain.
Like the mind flayer.
The what? What?
The mind flayer.
What the hell is that?
It's a monster from an unknown dimension.
It's so ancient that it doesn't even know its true home.
Okay, it enslaves races of other dimensions
by taking over their brains using its highlydeveloped psionic powers.
Oh, my God, none of this is real. This is a kids' game.
No, it's a manual. And it's not for kids.
And unless you know something that we don't,
this is the best metaphor
Analogy.
Analogy? That's what you're worried about?
Fine. An analogy for understanding whatever the hell this is.
Okay, so this mind flamer thing
Flayer. Mind flayer.
What does it want?
To conquer us, basically.
It believes it's the master race.
Like the Germans?
Uh, the Nazis?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Nazis. Uh...
If the Nazis were from another dimension, totally.
Uh, it views other races, like us, as inferior to itself.
It wants to spread, take over other dimensions.
We are talking about the destruction of our world as we know it.
That's great. That's great. That's really great. Jesus!
Okay, so if this thing is like a brain that's controlling everything,
then if we kill it...
We kill everything it controls.
We win. Theoretically.
Great. So how do you kill this thing? Shoot it with Fireballs or something?
No. No, no Fire No Fireballs.
Uh, you summon an undead army, uh, because...
...because zombies, you know, they don't have brains,
and the mind flayer, it... it... It likes brains.
It's just a game. It's a game. What the hell are we doing here?
I thought we were waiting for your military backup.
We are!
How are they gonna stop this?
You can't just shoot this with guns.
You don't know that! We don't know anything!
We know it's already killed everybody in that lab.
We know the monsters are gonna molt again.
We know that it's only a matter of time before those tunnels reach this town.
They're right.
We have to kill it.
I want to kill it.
Me, too. I
Me, too, Joyce, okay?
But how do we do that?
We don't exactly know what we're dealing with here.
No. But he does.
If anyone knows how to destroy this thing, it's Will.
He's connected to it. He'll know its weakness.
I thought we couldn't trust him anymore.
That he's a spy for the mind flayer now.
Yeah, but he can't spy if he doesn't know where he is.
Yeah, this'll work.
Hey.
What you did, um, helping the kids...
that was... really cool.
Yeah.
Those little shits are real trouble, you know?
Believe me, I know.
Hey.
I'm... I'm sorry about Dart and all.
I guess I just thought that he was my friend.
I was wrong.
I broke the rule of law,
so if you want your girlfriend to take over my spot in the party, I understand.
She's not my girlfriend.
I saw you two holding hands in the bus, Lucas.
She was just scared.
Maybe, but I could feel it.
Feel what?
The electricity.
I get why El was your mage now.
What?
Lucas. He told me all about her.
Well, he shouldn't have.
And just because you know the truth, it doesn't mean you're in our party.
You do know that, right?
Yeah, I know.
I mean, why would you want a stupid zoomer in your party anyway?
I'm just saying, El?
She sounds like she was really awesome.
Yeah, she was.
Until that thing took her.
Just like it took Bob.
You sure this is gonna work?
He knew who I was.
He's still in there.
It's gonna work.
It has to.
All right, you ready? Yeah.
If he finds out where we are...
will he send those dogs after us?
He won't find out.
Yeah, but, if he does...
Judgment day.
What? What? What is this?
What? What is this?
Why am I tied up?
Will, we just wanna talk to you.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Where am I?
You recognize this?
Do you recognize this?
Hey.
We wanna help you.
But to do that, we have to understand how to kill it.
Why am I tied up?
Why am I tied up?
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?
Hey.
Why am I tied up? Why am I tied up?
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go...
Go...
Go...
Do you know what March 22nd is?
It's your birthday.
Your birthday.
When you turned eight, I gave you that huge box of crayons.
Do you remember that?
It was 120 colors.
And all your friends, they got you Star Wars toys,
but all you wanted to do was draw with all your new colors.
And you drew this big spaceship, but it wasn’t from a movie.
It was your spaceship.
A rainbow ship is what you called it.
And you must have used every color in the box.
I took that with me to Melvald's
and I put it up and I told everyone who came in,
"""My son drew this."""
And you were so embarrassed.
But I was so proud.
I was so, so proud.
Do you remember the day Dad left?
We stayed up all night building Castle Byers...
just the way you drew it.
And it took so long because you were so bad at hammering.
You'd miss the nail every time.
And then it started raining, but we stayed out there anyway.
We were both sick for like a week after that.
But we just had to finish it, didn't we?
We just had to.
Do you remember the first day that we met?
It was... It was the first day of kindergarten.
I knew nobody.
I had no friends and...
I just felt so alone and so scared, but...
I saw you on the swings and you were alone, too.
You were just swinging by yourself.
And I just walked up to you and...
I asked.
I asked if you wanted to be my friend.
And you said yes.
You said yes.
It was the best thing I've ever done.
Will, baby...
if you're in there, just please... please talk to us.
Please, honey, please, can you do that for me?
Please. I love you so much.
Let me go.
What happened?
I think he's talking, just not with words.
What is that?
Morse code.
HERE.
Here.
Will's still in there. He's talking to us.
Do you remember the first time I played you this?
Mom and Dad were both arguing in the next room.
So I played you the mix tape I made you.
And it was the first time you got into music. Real music.
Dash, dot, dash, dot.
Yeah, got it. C.
And then the party escaped into the sewers,
and there were those big insect things, and you guys were still on level one.
L.
O.
Then you cast Fog Cloud and you saved us.
You saved the whole party.
S.
You saw that little girl and she was in the sandbox
and she was crying.
E.
You gave him your Tonka Truck
and I told you we couldn't afford to buy another one.
G.
You said she should have it because she's sad.
"""She's sad, Mommy."""
A.
I love you so much. T.
So, so much.
E.
"""Close gate."""
Shit. Shit.
Do you think he heard that?
It's just a phone. It could be anywhere. Right?
Hey. Hey, can you hear me?
It knows. It knows where we are.
Oh, shit.
That's not good.
They're coming! What?
Come on. We gotta go. Come on.
We gotta go. Okay.
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Hey. Hey, get away from the windows!
Do you know how to use this? What?
Can you use this?
I can.
Where are they?
What are they doing?
Holy shit.
Is it dead?
Eleven.
Mike.
Is that...
I never gave up on you.
I called you every night. Every night for
353 days.
I heard.
Why didn't you tell me you were there?
That you were okay? Because I wouldn't let her.
The hell is this? Where you been? Where have you been?
You've been hiding her.
You've been hiding her this whole time! Hey!
Let's talk.
Alone.
Protecting her! Protecting her? Listen. Listen to me.
The more people know about her, the more danger she's in.
And the more danger you and your family are in
So I should be thanking you?
I'm not asking you to thank me! I'm asking you to try to understand.
I don't! I don't understand!
That's fine. That's fine! Just do not blame her!
All right? She's upset enough as it is.
I don't blame her! I blame you! I blame you!
That's okay, kid. That's okay.
No! Nothing about this is okay!
Nothing about this is okay! Oh, jeez
You're a stupid, disgusting,
lying piece of shit! Okay. All right! Stop it.
Liar! Liar! Liar! Stop it. It's okay.
Stop it! Stop it! Liar! Liar!
You're okay, kid. You're okay.
I'm sorry, kid.
We missed you. I missed you, too.
We talked about you pretty much every day.
Teeth.
What? You have teeth.
Oh. You like these pearls?
Eleven?
Hey. Um, I'm Max.
I've heard a lot about you.
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.
Hey.
Can I see him?
He's not doing well.
I know.
I saw.
What else did you see?
You opened this gate before, right?
Yes.
Do you think if we got you back there, that you could close it?

Hold on, please.
Oh. Hi. Hi.
I, uh, didn't realize Nancy had a sister.
What's so funny?
I'm Nancy's mother.
No. Yes.
Mrs. Wheeler.
Um, I'm sorry, and you are?
Billy. Billy Hargrove.
You must be here for Nancy.
Nancy? No, no, no. Not my type. Uh...
No, actually, I am looking for my little sister Max.
Goes by Maxine.
She's been missing all day, and, uh, to be honest with you,
I've been worried sick, you know, so... Oh.
I thought she was at Lucas', but Mrs. Sinclair said your house is the...
the designated hangout, so, you know...
Here I am.
Their driveway is pretty dark this time of night.
So drive slowly.
Always.
And when you see Mike, tell him to come home already, okay?
You're a real lifesaver, you know that?
Anytime.

It's not like it was before. It's grown.
A lot. And, I mean, that's considering we can get in there.
The place is crawling with those dogs.
Demodogs.
I'm sorry, what? I said, uh, Demodogs.
Like Demogorgon and dogs.
You put them together, it sounds pretty badass
How is this important right now?
It's not. I'm sorry.
I can do it.
You're not hearing me.
I'm hearing you. I can do it.
Even if El can, there's still another problem.
If the brain dies, the body dies. I thought that was the whole point.
It is, but if we're really right about this...
I mean, if El closes the gate and kills the mind flayer's army...
Will's a part of that army.
Closing the gate will kill him.
He likes it cold. What?
It's what Will kept saying to me.
He likes it cold.
We keep giving it what it wants.
If this is a virus, and Will's the host, then...
Then we need to make the host uninhabitable.
So if he likes it cold...
We need to burn it out of him.
We have to do it somewhere he doesn't know this time.
Yeah, somewhere far away.
Take Denfield, then you'll see a large oak tree.
You're gonna swing a right. That road is gonna deadend.
And it's about a fiveminute walk from there.
Okay. Denfield to oak tree. Swing a right.
That's it. But it's channel ten, right?
It's channel ten. Listen...
You let me know when that thing is out of him.
You should go with him.
What? With Jonathan.
No, I'm... I'm not just gonna leave Mike.
No one's leaving anyone.
I may be a pretty shitty boyfriend, but...
turns out I'm actually a pretty damn good babysitter.
Steve...
It's okay, Nance.
It's okay.
I...
Just be careful, okay? I can't lose you again.
You won't lose me.
Do you promise?
Promise.
El... Come on, let's go. It's time.
Okay.
So, what, we're just not gonna talk about it, huh?
About what?
Oh, I don't know. I'm just curious, you know,
why all of a sudden you look like some kind of MTV punk.
I'm not mad, kid. I just want to know where you've been.
That's all.
To see Mama.
Okay.
How'd you get there? A truck.
A truck?
A big truck.
A big truck? Whose truck was it?
A man's. A man's?
A nice man.
Okay. So let me just get this straight in my head.
So a nice man in a big truck,
he drove you to your mama's, and then what?
Your Aunt Becky gave you those clothes and that makeup?
I...
I shouldn't have left.
Mmmmmm.
No.
No, this isn't on you, kid. I should've been there.
I should never have lied to you about your mom.
Or about when you could leave.
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.
Sometimes I feel like I'm...
Like I'm just some kind of black hole or something.
A black hole?
Yeah, it's a... You know, it's this thing in outer space.
It's like, it sucks everything towards it and destroys it.
Sarah had a picture book about outer space. She loved it.
Who's Sarah?
Sarah?
Sarah's my girl.
She's my little girl.
Where is she?
Well, that's kind of the thing, kid. She, uh...
She left us.
Gone. Yeah.
The black hole. It got her.
And somehow...
I've just been scared, you know?
I've just been scared that it would take you, too.
I think that's why I get...
so mad.
I'm so sorry.
For everything.
I could be so... so...
Stupid?
Yeah. Stupid.
Just really stupid.
I've been stupid, too.
I guess we broke our rule.
I don't hate it, by the way.
This whole...
look.
It's kinda cool.
Bitchin'.
Okay. Sure.
Bitchin'.
All right.
It should fit now.
Is this really necessary?
Yes, it is, okay? This is a groundbreaking scientific discovery.
We can't just bury it like some common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.
All right, all right, all right.
But you're explaining this to Mrs. Byers, all right?
Christ. Help me out.
What am I supposed to do? Get the door, man.
All right, I got the door.
Ew. Jesus God
Phew!
Mike, would you just stop already?
You weren't in there, okay, Lucas?
That lab is swarming with hundreds of those dogs.
Demodogs! The chief will take care of her.
Like she needs protection.
Listen, dude, a coach calls a play in a game,
bottom line, you execute it. All right?
Okay, first of all, this isn't some stupid sports game.
And second, we're not even in the game. We're on the bench.
So my point is...
Right, yeah, we're on the bench, so, uh, there's nothing we can do.
That's not entirely true.
I mean, these Demodogs, they have a hive mind.
When they ran away from the bus, they were called away.
If we get their attention... Maybe we can draw them from the lab.
Clear a path to the gate.
Yeah, and then we all die.
That's one point of view.
No, that's not a point of view, man. That's a fact.
I got it!
This is where the chief dug his hole. This is our way into the tunnel. So...
Here, right here. This is like a hub.
So you got all the tunnels feeding in here.
Maybe if we set this on fire...
Oh, yeah? That's a no.
The mind flayer would call away his army. They'd all come to stop us.
We circle back to the exit. Guys.
By the time they realize we're gone El would be at the gate.
Hey. Hey! Hey! This is not happening.
But No, no, no, no, no.
No buts. I promised I'd keep you shitheads safe,
and that's exactly what I plan on.
We're staying here. On the bench.
And we're waiting for the starting team to do their job.
Does everybody understand?
This isn't a stupid sports game.
I said does everybody understand that?
I need a yes.
It's my brother.
He can't know I'm here. He'll kill me. He'll kill us.
Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington?
Yeah, it's me. Don't cream your pants.
What are you doing here, amigo?
I could ask you the same thing.
Amigo.
Looking for my stepsister. A little birdie told me she was here.
Huh, that's weird. I don't know her.
Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch.
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, buddy.
You know, I don't know, this...
This whole situation, Harrington, I don't know.
It's giving me the heebiejeebies.
Oh, yeah? Why's that?
My 13yearold sister goes missing all day.
And then I find her with you in a stranger's house.
And you lie to me about it.
Man, were you dropped too much as a child, or what?
I don't know what you don't understand about what I just said.
She's not here.
Then who is that?
Shit! Did he see us?
Oh, shit. Listen
I told you to plant your feet.
Well, well, well.
Lucas Sinclair. What a surprise.
I thought I told you to stay away from him, Max.
Billy, go away. You disobeyed me.
And you know what happens when you disobey me.
Billy... I break things.
Billy! Stop! Billy! Stop!
Get off of me, you
Since Maxine won't listen to me, maybe you will.
You stay away from her.
Stay away from her! You hear me?
I said get off me!
So dead, Sinclair! You're dead.
No. You are.
Steve!
Looks like you got some fire in you after all, huh?
I've been waiting to meet this King Steve
everybody's been telling me so much about.
Get out.
Yes! Kick his ass, Steve! Get him!
Murder the son of a bitch!
Now! Now! Get that shithead!
Kill the son of a bitch!
Steve! Billy!
Holy shit!
Shit!
No one tells me what to do!
Whoo! Get up!
You're gonna kill him.
The hell is this?
You little shit, what did you do?
What did you do?
Shit.
From here on out, you leave me and my friends alone. Do you understand?
Screw you.
Say you understand! Say it! Say it!
I understand.
What? I understand.
Let's get out of here.
It's actually kinda nice.
We'll do it here.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
This thing has had Will long enough.
Let's kill the son of a bitch.
Papa!
All right. You let me do the heavy lifting up front, all right?
You save your strength till we're below.
You okay?
Nancy?
No, don't touch it.
Hey, buddy...
It's okay. You put up a good fight.
He kicked your ass, but you put up a fight.
You're okay.
Okay, you're gonna keep straight for a half a mile,
then make a left on Mount Sinai.
What's going on?
Oh, my God!
Just relax. She's driven before.
Yeah, in a parking lot. That counts.
They were gonna leave you behind.
Oh, my God.
I promised that you'd be cool, okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
Oh, my God. No! Whoa! Stop the car. Slow down.
I told you he'd freak out. Stop the car!
Everybody shut up! I'm trying to focus!
Oh, wait, that's Mount Sinai. Make a left.
What? Make a left.
What's happening?
It hurts.
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!
Let me go! Let me go! It hurts!
It hurts! Let me go! Let me go! It hurts!
Mom. No!
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
Hello!
Whoa! Incredible.
I told you. Zoomer.
Guys.
Oh, no. Guys.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
What are you, deaf? Hello?
We are not going down there right now. I made myself clear.
Hey, there's no chance we're going to that hole, all right?
This ends right now!
Steve, you're upset, I get it.
But the bottom line is, a party member requires assistance,
and it is our duty to provide that assistance.
Now, I know you promised Nance that you would keep us safe.
So, keep us safe.
Holy shit.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's this way.
You're pretty sure, or you're certain?
I'm 100% sure. Just follow me and you'll know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I don't think so.
What?
Any of you little shits die down here, I'm getting the blame. Got it, dipshit?
From here on out, I'm leading the way. Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Hey, a little hustle.
Stay here.
Oh, shit.
Hey, Doc.
Those suckers got you pretty good, huh?
It's okay, don't talk.
Don't talk. I got you. I got you. I got you.
Oh, yeah, I've been meaning to tell you.
This is Eleven. Eleven, Doc Owens. Doc Owens, Eleven.
She's been staying with me for about a year
and she's about to save our asses.
Maybe when this is all said and done,
maybe you could help her out, too, you know?
Maybe you could help her lead, like, a normal life.
One where she's not poked and prodded and...
treated like some kind of lab rat, you know?
I don't know, just a thought.
But, uh... think about it.
Don't go anywhere.
God.
What is this place?
Guys, come on. Keep moving.
What the hell?
Shit!
Help! Help! Help! Dustin.
Shit!
Dustin! Dustin!
What happened?
It's in my mouth! Some got on my mouth! Shit!
I'm okay.
You serious? Very funny, man.
Nice. Very nice. Jesus, what an idiot.
Hang on. Wait, wait.
All right, Wheeler.
I think we found your hub.
Drench it.
It's not working. It's not working. Mom, are you listening to me?
Just wait! How much longer?
Look... look at him!
Jonathan, wait! You're killing him!
Just wait!
No! No, leave it!
You're killing him! Leave it!
Wait, Jonathan, Jonathan! His neck! His neck!
No, no, no, no.
Stay here.
You ready? Yeah.
Ready. Ready.
Light her up.
I am in such deep shit.
All right.
Get the hell out of my son!
Go, go, go!
Let's go, let's go!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Will, baby.
Will. Will.
Please, Will. Will. Come on, buddy.
Please. Can you hear me? Come on.
Come on. Please. Will.
Mom?
Oh, honey. Oh, God.
Chief, are you there? Chief, do you copy?
Yeah, I copy.
Close it.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Hey, this way!
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help!
Hold on! Steve, pull him out.
Everybody back! Back!
You good? You okay?
Guys, we gotta go!
Dart.
Shh. Stop.
Dustin, get back. Trust me, please.
Hey. It's me, it's me. It's just your friend, it's Dustin.
It's Dustin, all right?
You remember me?
Will you let us pass?
Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the storm cellar.
That was a pretty douchey thing to do.
You hungry? Yeah?
He's insane. Don't.
Shut up.
I've got our favorite. See? Nougat.
Look at that. Yummy. Here, all right?
Eat up, buddy. Come on. Come on.
Let's go.
There's plenty. I've got more.
Goodbye, buddy.
Let's go, let's go!
I want you to find something from your past,
something that angers you.
Now channel it.
Papa!
Jesus!
What was that?
They're coming.
Run! Run!
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, Mike! Move, Mike!
There, there! Come on! Let's go.
Go, go, go! Let's go! Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Come on, hurry up! Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
Lucas, come on. Reach for my hand.
Come on. Pull him.
Oh, shit.
Here.
Dustin! Come on!
No!
This is...
Eleven.
Oh, shit!
You have a wound, Eleven.
A terrible wound.
The gate, I opened it.
And it's festering. I'm the monster.
And it will grow.
Spread.
Papa!
And eventually, it will kill you.
Jane!
You did good, kid.
You did so good.
Since the release of the incendiary tape,
the once quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana,
has spent time in a place it never expected.
The national spotlight.
Under mounting pressure, several highranking members
from the U.S. Department of Energy
have admitted involvement in the death and coverup
of Hawkins resident Barbara Holland who died due to exposure
to an experimental chemical asphyxiant,
which had leaked from the grounds of the lab.
We sent our own April Kline to Hawkins to speak to residents,
residents who told us they thought they lived in a safe town.
The kind of town where, they say, nothing ever happens.
Chiefo.
How's the leg? Better.
Pretty sure my football career is over.
Want some? No way I'm gonna finish it.
No. I'm, uh... on a diet.
Well, you're a better man than me.
Hey, got a little something for you.
I thought
Sometimes I impress even myself.
Still, I'd let things cool off for a while, if I were you.
How long is a while?
Want to be safe? I give it a year.
A year?
What about one night out?
One night?
Yeah. How risky would that be?
What's so important about one night?

You don't care. I don't care.
There you go. You're learning, my friend. You're learning.
Hey. What?
Come on. You look great, okay? You look... You look great.
Okay? Now you're gonna go in there... Yeah.
Look like a million bucks. Yeah.
And you're gonna slay 'em dead.

Don't do that, okay?
Okay.
Good luck.
Looking very snazzy tonight, sir. Thank you, my lord.
Hey, Nance. Hey.
What's in this? Pure fuel.
Holy shit. What happened to you?
"What do you mean, ""What happened""? What?"
Dude. Your hair.
Is there a bird nesting in there?
"What do you mean, ""What's wrong""?"
There's no bird nesting in here, asshole. Okay?
I worked hard.
Max...
Hey.
Um, it's nice, right?
You want to, um...
You want to, like... You know?
Like, just you and me?
Are you trying to ask me to dance, stalker?
No, of course not.
Unless you want to.
So smooth. Come on.
Hey, Zombie Boy.
Do you want to dance?
Um... I don't...
I mean... I mean, yeah. Sure. Cool.
Wish me luck, Mike. I'm going in.

Plus he's, like, not my type. Stacy.
Yeah?
Shall we?
Um, no, thanks.
Oh, my God.
Hey. Hey.
Wanna dance? What?
Come on. Let's go.
Here. Mmmhmm.
Closer.
A little closer. Okay.
Now feel the music.
The rhythm.
Start to move to it.
Yeah. There.
Good? That's good. Yeah.
Okay.
You know, out of all of my brother's friends,
you're my favorite.
You've always been my favorite. Really?
Yeah.
Girls this age are dumb.
But give them a few years, and they'll wise up.
And, uh, you're gonna drive them nuts.
You think so? Oh, I know so.
Hey. Hey.
Thought I might find you out here.
Will wanted me to give him some space, so...

So what, I'm just supposed to let them do whatever they want?
No, I didn't say that. I think you should... talk to them.
No. No. 'Cause talking doesn't work.
Not yelling. Not ordering.
But talk to them.
You know, like a hearttoheart.
A hearttoheart?
What is that?
You sit them down and you talk to them, like you're their friend.
I find if you talk to them like you're on their level,
then they really start to listen.
And then, you know, you could start to create some boundaries.
Boundaries. Yeah, but,
Hop, it's really important that no matter how they respond,
you stay calm.

Just speak louder. I intercepted
a secret Russian communication!
Jeez, shh. Yeah, okay, that's what I thought you said.
What What does that mean?
It means, Steve, we could be heroes.
True American heroes.
Huh. Mmhmm?
American heroes. Just think,
you could have all the ladies you want and more.
More? More.
I like more. Mmhmm.
What's the catch?
No catch, I just need your help.
With what?
Translation.
Shit!
Hi.
Hi?
Can we talk?
And then he said he he missed me.
And then he just hung up.
He's a piece of shit. What?
Mike doesn't have jack shit to do today, and his Nana obviously isn't sick.
I guarantee you, him and Lucas are playing Atari right now.
But friends don't lie.
Yeah, well, boyfriends lie.
All the time.
She knows I'm lying. She knows I'm lying.
I don't even understand. Why lie? Hopper.
He threatened me.
Did he say he'd kill you? What? No.
So then, what's the big deal? The big deal is
if I don't do what he says, then he'll stop me from seeing El.
Like, permanently.
You don't understand, Lucas. He's crazy.
He's lost his mind.
Hey, guys, I'm almost set up here.
I had no choice, Lucas. I really had no choice.
I just wish you'd consulted me,
because the way you handled this,
you're in deep shit.
You're going to stop calling him. You're going to ignore his calls.
As far as you're concerned, he doesn't exist.
Doesn't exist?
He treated you like garbage.
You're gonna treat him like garbage. Give him a taste of his own medicine.
Give him the medicine.
Mmhmm. And if he doesn't fix this,
if he doesn't explain himself,
dump his ass.
I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna be bad.
But...
you can fix this.
It's just one little mistake.
I've made hundreds, thousands.
Max has dumped me five times.
But what have I done?
Huh? Have I despaired? No.
I've marched back into battle,
and I've won her back every single freaking time.
How? I'll show you.
Come on.
Come on.
Where are we going? To have some fun.
There's more to life than stupid boys, you know.
Wait, guys!

So what do you think?
It sounded familiar. What?
The music. The music right there at the end.
Why are you listening to the music, Steve?
Listen to the Russian!
We're translating Russian! I'm trying to listen to the Russian,
but there's music All right, babysitting time is over.
You need to get in there.
Hey, my board. That was important data, shitbirds.
I guarantee you, what we're doing is way more important than your data.

How does she know about the Russians? I don't know.
You told her about It wasn't me.
Hello, I can hear you. Actually, I can hear everything.
You are both extremely loud.
You think you have evil Russians plotting against our country, on tape,
and you're trying to translate, but haven't figured out a word
because you didn't realize Russians use an entirely different alphabet.
Sound about right?
Whoa! What do you think you're doing? I wanna hear it.
Why? 'Cause maybe I can help.
I'm fluent in four languages, you know. Russian?
Ouyay areyay umbday.

Come on, it's your turn to sling ice cream, my turn to translate.
I don't even want credit. I'm just bored.
Yes?
Mrs. Driscoll? Yes?
Hi, um, I'm Nancy.
Nancy Wheeler. We spoke briefly on the phone last night.
We're from The Hawkins Post.
Oh! Oh, yes!
Oh, my goodness.
Oh. You look too young for reporters.
We get that a lot.
Follow me.
Oh, it's... it's lovely.
Um, do you live here all alone?
Yes. Jack, my husband,
he passed away, what is it now, ten years ago.
Oh, um... I'm... I'm so sorry.
Oh, don't be.
I kinda like the quiet.
At least, I did.
This way.
It's right over there.
You see those little teeth marks, don't ya?
And...
these bags, um...
you're sure they were full before?
I'm old, honey, not senile.
Bought them over at Blackburn's Supplies just last Tuesday.
Now you tell me,
why would rats want to eat a poor old woman's fertilizer?
Are you sure they did?
Maybe they just gnawed the bag? I mean...
eating fertilizer seems
Crazy. Believe me, I know, honey.
But...
...something's not right with these rats.
What does that mean, exactly...
"""not right""?"
Rabies, my guess.
That's when I said to myself,
"""Doris, you gotta call the paper."
Because if those diseased rats are runnin' loose,
"the people, they oughta know."" Wouldn't you agree?"
Oh, yes, I forgot to mention!
Come on over here.
I caught one of the little bastards.

Mayor Kline is ready for you.
Great.
Thank you.
Jim.
Thanks for coming by.
I'm not doing it, Larry.
Calm down, now. You don't even know what I want.
You don't like your fan club, you want me to shut 'em down. Sound about right?
When'd you get so serious?
Take a seat.
My fan club, as you call them,
now, you know why they're out there, don't ya?
They're not actually fans?
They lost their jobs to the mall
and blame me for helping make that happen.
Now,
you go ask anyone else in this town.
They all love the mall.
It's helped our economy grow, brought in new jobs,
and just some incredible new stores.
Which is why they all stopped shopping at their, uh, momandpops.
Now, that's not me, Jim.
Mmhmm? Uhuh.
That's just, uh, good old fashioned American capitalism.
Well, Larry, I think that they're just exercising
their good old fashioned American right to protest.
I agree.
Yeah. If.
If they had a permit.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong here, Jim, but, uh...
I don't believe they secured a permit from your office,
did they?
Not that I'm aware of.
Then I do believe it's within my right to get rid of them.
Larry,
I'm not a politics guy,
but I think if you force those people out of here without provocation,
I don't think that's a good look for your reelection campaign.
You know what's in four days, Jim?
Independence Day?
That's right.
And I'm gonna throw this town the biggest bash it's ever seen.
Fireworks, music, activities, you name it.
I'm gonna pull out all the stops. You know why?
'Cause at the end of the day, that's all the voters will remember.
But I can't think, much less plan,
with all that racket going on out there.
So, if you don't mind,
please...
just do your job.
Flash your little gold badge,
and get rid of them.
So, what do you think?
Hey, what's wrong?
Too many people.
Against the rules.
Seriously?
You have superpowers.
What's the worst that could happen?
So, what should we do first?
You've never been shopping before, have you?
Well, then I guess we're just gonna have to try everything.
Ooh. Come on.
I just... I don't understand what we're looking for.
"Something pretty and shiny that says ""I'm sorry."""
"What, just something that literally says ""I'm sorry""?"
No!
Do you like that?
How do I know... what I like?
You just try things on.

Like me?
Yeah.

That's a lot of color for you, Chief.
It's cuttingedge stuff, all right?
It's cuttingedge!
I'll start off with a Scotch, you can make that a double.
Very good, sir.
And I think we'll have a bottle of red, as well.
Very good, sir.

Our Chianti is quite good. Chianti.

Great.
Women love cherries, huh?
All right, we'll have that and two two glasses, please,
one for, uh, me and one for the lady.
Ooh. Very good, sir.
And what is this again?
This is a solenoid.
It's a coil, wrapped around a metallic core,
and when electricity passes through it...
It creates an electromagnetic field.
Exactamundo.
Now for the fun part.
Shall we? Yeah.
I... I don't see anything.
Nope.
You can't see it, but it's there, I assure you.
Our very own ClarkeByers Electromagnetic Field.
Pretty neato, huh?
Yeah.
And this field affects any charged object in its vicinity.
Just like my magnets. Just like your magnets.
Okay, why is nothing happening?
Oh, because our field is stable.
But, if we reduce the current...
How...
The magnetic dipoles tried to orient according to the field, but
No, no, no, I mean, how is this happening at my house?
You want my honest opinion?
One of your kiddos got up in the middle of the night,
bumped into the fridge, and knocked the suckers loose.
And the magnets at Melvald's?
Apophenia. Apowhatowhah?
Apophenia. Uh...
You're seeing patterns that aren't there. Coincidence.
But what if...
it's not?
Well...
Theoreticallyspeaking,
I suppose some large version of this AC transformer could exist.
A machine of some kind.
A machine?
But, in order to reach your house and downtown, gosh,
that would take billions of volts of electricity
and cost tens of millions of dollars.
But it is possible.
We cured polio in '53.
Landed on the moon in '69.
As I tell my students,
once you open up that curiosity door,
anything is possible.
"""The week is long,"
the silver cat feeds,
"when blue meets yellow in the west."""
I mean, it just...
it just can't be right.
It's right. Honestly, I think it's great news.
How is this great news?
I mean, so much for being American heroes.
It's total nonsense. It's not nonsense.
It's too specific. It's obviously a code.
What do you mean, a code? Like a super secret spy code.
That's a total stretch. I don't know, is it?
You're buying into this?
Listen, just for kicks,
let's entertain the possibility that it is a secret Russian transmission.
"What'd you think they were gonna say, ""Fire the warhead at noon""?"
Exactly. And my translation is correct.
I know that for sure, so...
"""The silver cat feeds."" Why would anyone talk like that"
unless they're trying to mask
the meaning of their message? Exactly.
Why would anyone mask the true meaning of their message
unless the message was somehow sensitive?
Exactly.
So I guess that confirms your suspicion. Evil Russians.
I can't believe I'm about to agree with this strange child, but,
yeah, totally evil Russians.
So how do we crack it?
Well, I guess we translate the rest and hopefully a pattern emerges.
"A pattern. Right, like maybe ""silver cat"" is a meeting place?"
Or a person.
Or a weapon.
It's probably gonna take a super genius to crack it, but...

Hopper? Are you there?
Oh! Look who it is!
We need to talk.
Yeah, we do.
I haven't been stood up like that since Alice Gilbert in the 9th grade.
What are you doing?
Joyce.
Hello? Just watch.
Okay, you're freaking me out.
You slipped on this, remember? Yeah.
Yeah, it fell in the night. It lost its magnetism.
Oh, did it? And the same exact thing happened
at my house the day before.
"Wow. And I thought, ""Okay, that's weird."""
Right? Why are all these magnets suddenly losing their magnetism?
Uhhuh? So, I went and saw Scott.
Scott.
Who's Scott?
Scott Clarke. Your child's science teacher?
He's pretty brilliant, actually.
"And I asked him, ""How is this happening?"""
And he built this magnetic field using an AC transformer
and plugging it into a solenoid.
And And with that solenoid, which basically
Slow down, slow down.
I just want to get this exactly right, okay?
You stand me up...
...no phone call, no apology,
because you had to go to Scott Clarke's house.
Yeah.
You've outdone yourself, Joyce.
You really have. No, you've outdone yourself.
Oh, come on, Hop, you're not even listening to me.
Scott was able to demagnetize some of the magnets, and he thinks
I don't care what Scott thinks!
He thinks that a largescale magnetic field could be built
using some sort of machine or or experimental technology.
He's brilliant, isn't he?
He's really brilliant. Is he single too?
What if it's them?
To build a machine like this, you need resources.
You need scientists, you need funding,
tens of millions of dollars. Joyce.
It can't just be a coincidence, Hopper.
It has to be them.
Joyce, stop.
It has to be the lab.
It is impossible.
Well, then, prove it to me. Prove it?
Yeah, take me back there. To the lab.
Yeah, I wanna go back.
Because some magnets fell off your fridge.
Yes.
Okay, makes sense.
Thank you.
It makes sense.
I'm sorry.
I'm a little busy right now, but maybe we can meet up there,
like tonight, like seven o'clock?
You know, of course, unless something comes up
which, you know, it will. You know,
after everything that's happened,
this is no joke.
No, I don't think it's a joke.
I think that when I asked you out, I think you got scared.
I think you got scared, and now, you're inventing things.
You're inventing things to get worked up about
so that you can push me away.

but you said Mike has sensed you in there before, right?
So maybe it was just like that. Maybe Billy just...
sensed you somehow.

Huh. I got this, okay?

So, what exactly are we looking at here? Is this the Driscoll lady's stuff?
No. No, see, that's the thing. I mean,
listen, I thought she was crazy too, but
She told me Johnson killed Kennedy.
But, it turns out, she's not alone.
Blackburn's Supply, Hawkins Farming, the Crawleys,
they've all had some supplies go missing, all in the past few days.
And it's not just fertilizer.
It's pesticides, cleaning supplies, diesel fuel.

there's gotta be more.

"""Hawkins Rodents Prefer Poison: Nutjob Tells All."""
Guys, that's enough.
I think this is...
big.
Bigger than one article.
In fact, I think this has got to be a book.
The Mysterious Case of the Missing Fertilizer,
a Nancy Drew mystery.
Next time a call comes in,
do what you were hired for,
and let us know, yeah?
Ah...
We'll decide what's a story and what's not.
Okay.
Byebye, Nancy Drew.
Hey, it's okay. Nancy. Nancy!
Excuse me.
Ahoy!
I'd like to try the peanut butter chocolate swirl, please.
No. No more samples today.
Why not?
Because you're abusing our company policy.
Where's the sailor man?
Sorry, he can't help you. He's busy.
Busy with what?
Spycraft.
You see anything?
Uh, I guess I don't totally know what I'm looking for.
Evil Russians.
Yeah, exactly. I don't know what an evil Russian looks like.
Tall, blond, not smiling. Mmhmm?
Also, look for earpieces,
camo, duffel bags, that sort of thing.
Right, okay, duffel bags.
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me. What?
Anna Jacobi's talking with that meathead Mark Lewinsky.
If you're not gonna focus, just gimme the binoculars.
Aw, Jesus Christ, whatever happened to standards?
I mean, Lewinsky never even came off the bench.
Dude, you are the worst spy in history, you know that?
Stop, hey. Stop. Give me those.
I don't get why you're looking at girls. You have the perfect one in front of you.
Seriously, if you say Robin again Robin.
No, don't. No. Robin, Robin, Robin.
Stop, no, no, no. Robin. Robin.
Robin. No.
Robin. No!
No, man, she's not my type.
She's not even...
in the ballpark of what my type is, all right?
What's your type again? Not awesome?
Thank you. Hm.
For your information, she's still in school. And she's weird.
She's a weirdo. And she's hyper.
I don't like that she's hyper.
And she did drama. That's a bad look.
And she's in band?
No. Now that you're out of high school,
which means you're technically an adult, don't you think it's time you move on
from primitive constructs such as popularity?
Oh, primitive constructs? That some stupid shit you learned at Camp...
Know... Nothing?
Camp Know Where, actually.
And no, it's shit I learned from life. Hm.
Instead of dating somebody you think's gonna make you cooler,
why not date somebody you actually enjoy being around?
Like me and Suzie.
Oh, Suzie.
"Yeah, you mean, ""hotter than Phoebe Cates."""
Yeah, that Suzie.
And, uh, let's think about
how exactly did you score that beautiful girlfriend?
Oh, yeah. With my advice.
Because that's how this works, Henderson.
I give you the advice, you follow through.
Not the other way around, all right, peabrain?
Do you guys hear that?
It sounds like... thunder.
But, no, wait. That's not thunder.
It's...
a horde of juju zombies!
Sir Mike, your action.
What should I do?
Attack?
Okay, I attack with my flail.
Whoosh!
You miss.
Your flail clanks the stone, the zombie horde lumbers towards you, and...
the juju bites your arm. Flesh tears!
Aah!
Seven points of damage.
Oh, no, my arm.
Lucas, look, my arm.
Sir Lucas, the zombie horde roars!
Do you fight back or do you run?
No! It's a distraction!
A trap. Do not answer it.
What... No!
El?
No.
Sorry, not interested.
Telemarketers.
Maybe we should just call them.
We can do that?
I think so. Yeah, but what would we say?
We'll say nothing! The Khuisar tribe still needs your help.
All right, then.
I'll use my torch to set fire to the chambers, sacrificing ourselves,
killing the jujus, and saving the Khuisar.
We all live on as heroes in the memories of the Kalamar.
Victory.
Okay. Fine.
You guys win.
Congratulations. Will, I was just messing around.
Hey, let's finish for real.
How much longer is the campaign? Just forget it, Mike.
No, you want to keep playing, right?
YYeah, totally.
We'll just call the girls afterwards. I said forget it, Mike, okay?
I'm going home. But...
Come on, Will. Move!
Will, come on.
You can't leave. It's raining.
Listen, I said I was sorry, all right?
It's a cool campaign. It's really cool.
We're just not in the mood right now. Yeah, Mike. That's the problem.
You guys are never in the mood anymore.
You're ruining our party. That's not true.
Really? Where's Dustin right now?
See? You don't know and you don't even care.
And obviously he doesn't either and I don't blame him.
You're destroying everything, and for what?
So you can swap spit with some stupid girl?
El's not stupid.
It's not my fault you don't like girls.
I'm not trying to be a jerk. Okay?
But we're not kids anymore.
I mean, what did you think, really?
That we were never gonna get girlfriends?
We were just gonna sit in my basement all day
and play games for the rest of our lives?
Yeah.
I guess I did.
I really did.
Will.
Will!
Will, come on!
Excuse me.
No one in the water until 30 minutes after the last strike.
And don't try and argue with me.
You wanna get electrocuted, go climb a tree.
Yeah, we don't care. We're not here to swim.
Or get electrocuted.
We found this.
Does that belong to anybody?
Oh, yeah.
That's Heather's.
I'll get it back to her.
We could give it back to her.
You could.
'Cept she's not here.
Bailed on me today.
What is this?
You girls want a reward or somethin'?
No.
We're just...
Good Samaritans.
Heather.
Do you think you can find her?
No way!
What do you see?
A door.
A red door.
Help me.
Help me!
No!
What happened? El!
Hello?
Anybody home?
We come in peace.
No!
No!
Let's go!

You okay?
I'm fine.
You want to wait in the car?
I said I'm fine.

Slow down.
We're losin' him.
You're getting too close. Watch it, dickwad.
Hello. Yes. I am fine.
How are you?
All right, everyone, listen up!
I just have one question for you.
Who...
is ready to sweat?
That's right!
Okay! Let's start it nice and easy now.
Let's move our thighs. Yeah!
Yeah, ladies, warm it up.
Bring it down to your hips.
Start feeling that burn,
everywhere, down in the loins, right?
Come on, ladies, show me what you got.
Slow now. Just isolate.
Ooh, tip that up. That feels good!

Ohhoho! Oh!
There it is!
Careful! It might have rabies!
Better get that thing outta here.
You don't want it eatin' the tires off your car.
Come on!
What
What's this? Proof.
Proof?
They said they wanted proof, right? So let's give it to 'em.
A rubber rat?
No, the real rat.
Driscoll's rat.
You said yourself it looked sick.
We can take it to an animal control center,
they can run some blood tests on it,
figure out what's wrong with it Whoa, Nancy, slow down.
Tom didn't ask for proof.
He asked us to drop the story.
That's because he didn't believe us.
Nancy.
I'm right.
That's not the point.
Then what's the point?
You should've thought about that before you talked to them.
All right? They're assholes, okay? I get it.
But it's just some stupid story.
Oh, it's stupid?
It's stupid to get fired over.
No one's going to fire us.
Look, if you don't want to go, that's fine.
Just...
give me the keys.
You're relentless, you know that?
Come on.
Nobody's home.
All the cavities have been filled.
I watched 'em do it, Joyce.
Will!
It's over.
It's over.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.
You're not losing your mind.
Not any more than I am.
You know, the other day, I almost shot Betsy Payne's dog
because it came rushing at me from behind this fence, and I...
I swear to God, I thought it was one of those things.
You know that I'm keeping a close eye on things, right?
Yeah. Because it's important to me.
It is important to me that you feel safe.
That you and your family feel safe.
I want you to feel
like this can still be your home.
What?
You didn't think I'd find out about that?
Gary called me.
He said he's fixing up your house to put on the market.
The kids know yet?
After Sarah...
I had to get away.
I had to get the hell out of that place, you know?
Outrun those, uh...
those memories, I guess.
I mean, why do you think I ended up back in this shithole?
But you have something that I never had.
You have people that know what you've been through.
You have people that care about you.
Right here.
In Hawkins.
You mean...
You mean, people like Scott Clarke.
That was a joke.
Mm.
What's that?
Wait here.
Will!
Will, I'm sorry, man, all right?
I was being a total asshole.
Please, can you just come outside and we'll talk?
Will!
Hey, Will!
Come on, man! We're sorry!
Will!
Something is coming,
something hungry for blood.
What is it? What if it's the Demogorgon?
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed if it's the Demogorgon.
It's not the Demogorgon.

is my sister, Maxine.
Oh!
What on earth are you doing here?

He said you guys didn't come in to work today, so we got worried.
Heather wasn't feeling so hot today,
so we thought we'd take the day off to nurse her back to health.
But you're feeling just fine right now, aren't you, Heather?
I'm feeling so much better.

What happened?
Help me.
No!
Which one?
I don't know.
Hey, there's nothing to worry about anymore, okay?
It doesn't make sense.
What doesn't make sense?
Heather.
The blood.
The ice.
Heather had a fever, so she took a cold bath, but she's better now.
That has to be it.
I don't know where that blood came from, but...
we saw her.
We both saw her. She's totally fine.
What about Billy?
What about him?
He seemed wrong.
Wrong is kind of like his default.
But it's nice to know he's not a murderer, because that would've totally sucked.
Who... is that?
See, this is why you can't just hang out with Mike all the time.
This is Wonder Woman.
AKA Princess Diana.
She's from Paradise Island, which is, like, this hidden island
where there are only women Amazon warriors.
Let me go! Let me go!
Doris, we need you to stay calm for us, okay?
Stay calm. I have to go back!
I have to go back!
I have to go back!
I have to go back!
Okay, so,
you two want to explain to me what in the name of Jesus
just happened here?
Tom!
Hi, Daddy.
Heather...
sweetie...
whatever this is, whatever he's got you into,
you don't have to do this.
You can stop this.
There is no stopping it, Daddy.
You'll see.
No.
Heather, please! Heather!
Try not to move.
No.
No.
Heather!
Heather!
Jesus Christ.
No.
No
Hey, careful.
Careful.
Here.
Hey.
Joyce.
Oh.
Here, here, here.
It's okay.
That's it. Got it?
Here. How long have I been out?
A while.
You've been drifting in and out.
Yeah, but how did I get here?
Slowly.
What's the last thing you remember? Some thug attacked me.
Hey, you need to rest. No, I'm fine.
No, you're not fine, Hop I'm fine. I'm fine.
Um...
Where are my clothes? Uh...
Uh...
They were soaked.
I mean, did you recognize him?
Who? The thug.
Well, I didn't get a good look.
Well, I mean, he's gotta be government, right?
Yeah, but if he's government, what's he doing slinking around?
WWhy is he running?
You know, why didn't we find anything down there?
Let's ask him.
What is that?
His license plate.
What are the dashes? Well, they're blanks.
There was... I think it was either an H or a P
with the part rubbed off.
And there was definitely a Y.
For sure.
And that, I think, was a B, but it could've been an eight.
And that Wait
I think you should stick to sales.
Can't you run a search or something?
I just think you have to lower your expectations.
I mean, this is a state government agency.
Gonna take weeks before they find a match.
Weeks? If we're lucky.
And, I mean,
what are the odds that this guy
registers a car in his own name?
It wasn't a car.
Uh, what are you wearing?
What do you mean it wasn't a car?
Do you copy?
This is a code red.
I repeat, this is a code red.
Max. Do you copy?
This is a code red.
Shut...
up.
She turned it off.
You've got to be kidding me.
I'm sleeping. Go away.
This is Mike. Do not hang up.
Something happened, something bad.
Our very lives can be at stake.
What are you talking about? Just come over to my house.
We'll explain everything.
What? Hurry.
What did he say?
Try Dustin again.
He's not answering.
So, try him again.
Dustin, do you copy?
I repeat, this is a code red.
That keycard opens the door, but unfortunately,
the Russian with this keycard also has a massive gun.
Whatever's in this room, whatever's in those boxes,
they really don't want anybody finding it.
But there's gotta be a way in.
Well, you know...
I could just take him out.
Take who out? The Russian guard.
What? I sneak up behind him,
I knock him out, and I take his keycard. It's easy.
Did you not hear the part about the massive gun?
Yes, Dustin, I did.
And that's why I would be sneaking.
Ah.
Well, please, tell me this, and be honest,
have you ever actually... won a fight?
Okay, that was one time
Twice. Jonathan. Year prior?
Listen, that doesn't count.
Why wouldn't it? Because it looks like he beat the shit out of you.
It was... You got a fat lip, crooked nose,
swollen eye, a lot of blood... ...things that all added up...
That just might work.
Robin.
Hey, Robin! Hey, what what are you doing?
I need cash. Well, half of that's mine.
Where're you going? To find a way into that room,
a safe way.
And, in the meantime, sling ice cream,
behave, and don't get beat up.
I'll be back in a jiff.
Oh, dude.
Come on, man, not my scooper.
If he gets us the layout by noon, we can.
Okay, I'll let him know.
Dunno if they'll go through with it, but I just thought you should know.
Nancy.
Jonathan.
I've worked at this paper for twentyfive years.
Twentyfive...
years.
Now, we're a smalltown paper,
but we have something the big papers don't have:
trust.
The trust of our community. Tom, if you just
Do you know how I built that trust? By placing my faith in something
the two of you don't seem to value a whole lot:
facts.
Facts.
So, while we're here, let's go over the facts.
Fact one: you disobeyed a direct order to stop pursuing this story.
Two: you falsely identified yourselves as reporters,
repeatedly lying to an elderly woman.
Three: you broke into her home, committing trespass.
Four: she almost died en route to the hospital.
She would've died if we hadn't shown up!
Whatever disease that rat had clearly passed to her
Five! Mrs. Driscoll is a paranoid schizophrenic.
You didn't know that, did you?
Now...
diseasecarrying rats?
The second coming of the plague? Does this sound credible to you,
or perhaps does this sound more like the delusions of a very sick old lady?
I didn't know that. Her family's furious.
So furious, in fact, they've threatened litigation.
Litigation? That's crazy.
For once, we agree.
This is crazy.
In fact, in my entire professional career,
I've never dealt with anything quite like it.
But hopefully,
hopefully, you've learned something valuable here.
You've learned...
how in the workplace,
in the real world,
there are consequences to your actions.
Which brings me to my sixth and final...
fact.
You're fired.
Both of you.
I didn't think it was anything at first.
I mean, I think I just didn't want to believe it.
The first time I felt it was at Day of the Dead.
Power went out that night, too. And then I felt it again
at the field near the Nelson farm the next day.
Then again yesterday outside Castle Byers.
Will!
What does it feel like?
It's almost like...
You know when you drop on a roller coaster?
Sure. Yeah.
No. It's like...
everything inside your body
is just sinking all at once, but...
this is worse.
Your body...
it goes cold and and you can't breathe.
I've felt it before,
whenever he was close.
Whenever who was close?
The Mind Flayer.
Go away!
Go away!
I closed the gate.
I know, but...
what if he never left?
What if we locked him out here with us?
This is him.
All of him.
But, that day on the field,
a part of him attached itself to me.
My mom got it out of me...
Get the hell out of my son!
...and Eleven closed the gate.
But the part that was still in me, what if it's still in our world?
In Hawkins.
I don't understand. The Demodogs died when El closed the gate.
If the brain dies, the body dies.
We can't take any chances.
We need to assume the worst.
The Mind Flayer's back.
Yeah. And if he is,
he'd want to attach himself to someone again.
A new me.
A new host.
How can you tell if someone is a host?
Hey, is he in?
Yes, he's busy at the moment, but Great.
Excuse me.
You should sit down.
...wouldn't listen
Uh...
Tony, hold on.
Let me, uh...
I might have to Let me call you back. Okay.
Thanks.
Jim. I know, I know.
You're busy. I'm gonna make this fast, I promise.
Is there...
some kind of problem?
Yeah. You might say that.
Um, I'm looking for the name of a guy.
The name of a guy.
Yeah, I think you might know this guy.
Okay. He was here the other day.
Rides a motorcycle.
Big build, square jaw, dark hair.
He's probably military, maybe exmilitary?
Is this ringing... any bells?
Uh...
I don't think so.
Really?
'Cause it was just two days ago.
This was right before I saw you.
Oh!
You know what? What?
Could be the maintenance guy.
Maintenance. Yeah. I can't remember his name.
Oh, God... Uh...
Gary or John or something.
Candice will have his name on file.
We've had trouble with the plumbing. Clogged toilets and...
sinks with minds of their own.
You meeting with a lot of plumbers, Larry?
Excuse me?
This guy, when I saw him, he was coming out of your office.
Okay, well, I don't remember that.
I shake a lot of hands, you know?
Do you remember when I caught you passed out in the hideaway
with all that powder all over your nose?
You remember? Jim, come on, now.
Do you remember when my boys found you and Candice going at it
like a couple of bunnies in the back of your Cadillac?
Do you remember that?
Does your wife remember that?
You, uh...
You really wanna play this game?
Huh?
Not a game, Lar.
Okay.
Those pills you used to swallow like candy.
I can't recall, did you have a prescription for those?
Or how about drinking on duty?
Yeah.
We have some real fun stories about that.
One call to Tom at the Post...
and you're done, buddy.
You're gone.
Oh, and, please,
don't give me that dead daughter sob story,
'cause I just don't care.
Now, if you don't mind,
I really am rather busy.
Operating directors
Damn it!
My nose! You broke my goddamn nose!
And your friend almost killed me last night,
so I'd say we're still not even.
Larry?
Let's cut the crap, Larry! Larry!
Who is this guy? Government? Military? You're making a big mistake.
Who is he?
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Larry!
Who you calling? The police?
That is a nice ring you got there, Larry.
Are you insane?
I don't know.
Let's find out.
Okay, okay, okay. Be cool, be cool.
I don't know his name, I swear.
Ah, ah, ah!
But you know him.
He... He gives me things sometimes.
What kind of things?
Money. Presents. Aah! Gifts.
Who is this guy, Santa Claus?
Starcourt. Starcourt. He works for Starcourt.
The mall? Yes, yes.
Yeah, right.
Aah! I swear! I swear! I swear! Starcourt.
They They own the mall.
They want to expand to East Hawkins. They needed property, some land.
Some people didn't want to sell, so I leaned on them a little. That's all.
I swear, that's all.
Why do they want this land? I don't know!
You have records of these purchases, these, uh...
these land purchases?
You don't want to mess with these people, Jim.
I think you should worry about yourself right now, Larry, not about me.
The records.
Where are they?
Larry?
He just bumped his head.
Just a little booboo, right, Lar?
Have a nice day.
Larry!
It's bullshit.
So, according to Tom, Driscoll's just a schizophrenic?
And that rat is just a rat?
And it's all, what, some big coincidence?
You know what I think?
I think Tom was on drugs.
What? Did you see him?
He was sweating like crazy.
And his palms were clammy.
He looked awful.
Oh, is this funny to you? No.
No, it's just kind of incredible.
Incredible?
Yeah, incredible how you just continue to convince yourself.
What's that supposed to mean?
I told you over and over to drop this story.
That it was a bad idea.
But you refused, and now, I'm screwed.
It's a summer job. Your life is hardly over.
I don't live in a twostory house on Maple Street.
My dad doesn't earn six figures.
Hell, he isn't even around.
God, here comes the Oliver Twist routine.
Mortgage, college tuition.
You know, they're real things, Nancy.
Things that you don't care about, only because you don't have to.
I didn't realize I lived in a bubble! Well, you do!
You want everything handed to you on a silver platter.
I mean, we were interns, Nancy!
Interns!
What did you expect, that you would make star reporter in a month?
Crack the big case?
You sound just like them. You realize that, right?
Just like Bruce and those assholes
Yeah, yeah, those assholes gave us jobs.
Is that what that was? That was humiliating.
Humiliating.
Yeah, the real world sucks.
Deal with it like the rest of us.
You don't know what it's like.
Neither do you.
Well, then, I guess we just don't understand each other anymore.
Yeah, I guess not.
Hey, you're home early.
Yeah. Light day.
It is fascinating what 20 bucks will get you
at the County Recorder's Office.
Starcourt Mall.
The complete blueprints.
Not bad.
So, this is us, Scoops,
and this is where we want to get.
I mean, I don't really see a way in.
There's not,
if you're talking exclusively about doors.
Air ducts.
Exactly.
Turns out, this secret room needs air just like any old room.
And these air ducts
lead all the way...
here.
Flashlight.
Thank you.
Yeah, I don't know, man. I don't know if you can fit in here. It's, like...
super tight.
I'll fit.
Trust me. No collar bones, remember?
Uh, excuse me?
Oh, he's, uh... Yeah, he's got some disease.
Chry, uh... It's chrydo, um...
Something. Yeah, I dunno.
He's missing bones and stuff. He can bend like Gumbo.
You mean Gumby.
I'm pretty sure it's Gumbo.
Steve, just shut up and push me! Okay.
I'll push ya.
Not my feet, dumbass. Push my ass. What?
Touch my butt! I don't care!
Come on! Harder! Push harder! I'm pushing!
You're playing with my legs. I'm not playing, I have terrible footing.
Come on! I'm gonna just shove you, ready?
Just shove me? One, two...
Shit. That work?
One more time. Ahoy, sailors! All hands on deck!
Ahoy!
Come on.
Get over here and serve me some samples.
I don't know. He looks pretty normal to me.
Normal? How many times have you seen him with a shirt on?
I mean, it's a little weird.
More than a little.
He was in a tub with ice. The Mind Flayer likes it cold.
Plus everything else But he's lounging at the pool,
which is, like, the least Mind Flayer thing ever.
Not necessarily.
The Mind Flayer likes to hide.
He only used me when he needed me.
It's like... like you're dormant.
And then, when he needs you,
you're activated.
Okay, so we just...
wait until he gets activated.
No. What if he hurts someone?
Or kills someone.
We can't take that chance.
We need to find out if he's the host.
Where are you going? I have an idea. Boys only.
Seriously? Just trust me on this one.
Okay, so we wait until the pool closes, until everyone leaves,
and we somehow get him to come from here and...
get him into here.
Hey, shut the door! Hey, come on, kid, shut it!
I think I just threw up in my mouth.
And look, the controls are right here. It's perfect.
Will it get hot enough? 220 degrees.
We just have to figure out how to get him in here.
Then we lock him in... Heat him up...
No matter what happens, we'll know.
We'll know for sure.
Hmm...
Yeah, I don't know. You don't know if you can fit?
Oh, I can fit. I just don't know if I want to.
Are you claustrophobic?
I don't have phobias.
Okay, well, what's the problem? The problem is,
I still haven't heard what's in this
for Erica.
More fudge, please.
Go on.
All right.
You see this? This is the route you're gonna take.
Then we just wait till the last delivery goes out tonight.
Then you knock out the grate, jump down, open the door.
Then you find out what's in those boxes? Exactly.
Mmhmm.
And you say this guard is armed.
Yes, but he won't be there.
And booby traps? Booby traps?
Lasers, spikes in the wall? What?
You know what this halfbaked plan of yours sounds like to me?
Child endangerment.
We'll be in radio contact with you the whole time
Ah, ah, ah!
Child endangerment.
Erica? Hi. Uh...
We think these Russians want to do harm to our country.
Great harm. Don't you love your country?
"You can't spell ""America"" without ""Erica."""
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Oddly, that's, uh, totally true.
So, so, don't do this for us.
Do it for your country.
Do it for your fellow man.
Do this for America... Erica.
Ooh!
I just got the chills.
Oh, yeah, from this float,
not your speech.
Know what I love most about this country?
Capitalism.
Do you know what capitalism is? Yeah.
Yeah. It means this is a free market system.
Which means people get paid for their services,
depending on how valuable their contributions are.
And it seems to me,
my ability to fit into that little vent
is very, very valuable to you all.
So, you want my help?
This USS Butterscotch
better be the first of many.
And I'm talking free ice cream
for life.
Wow, I love the place, Lar.
Hey, you shoot that fella yourself?
That's That's not real.
No shit!
All right, so...
what exactly are we looking at?
Land deeds, transfers of property.
So your buddies at Starcourt,
they suddenly start buying up all this property.
They tell you why? I already told you,
they don't tell me anything.
They're just using you, I get it.
What I don't get
is why you have a bunch of land deeds
in a safe in your bedroom.
These people, Jim,
they're bad news.
So, what, this is blackmail?
Protection. Protection.
Hold on a second.
Hey, what is it?
Hess Farm, Henry's place,
Bullocks...
Look, they're all here.
They're all in Southeast Hawkins, right near Jordan Lake.
And what else is near Jordan Lake?
The power plant.
Four nights ago, there was a huge power outage,
and the next day Your magnets fell.
Yeah, I mean, Scott says that this machine
would take a massive amount of power to run.
Yeah. So, what if this machine
that we've been talking about really does exist,
and the reason that we didn't find it at the lab
is because it isn't at the lab, it's at one of these properties.
Um...
I want you to... forget about sales.
I want you to come work for me at the Hawkins PD.
And have to look at your face every day? I don't think so.
Larry!
Hey!
Hey, where do you think you're going, pal?
Nancy?
Nance?
Maybe Jonathan's right.
To be honest, I wasn't thinking about him.
I wasn't thinking about anyone, really.
I just...
I wanted to be right.
I wanted to be right so badly. And were you?
I thought so.
But maybe I just...
don't want to admit that I'm wrong,
because if I'm wrong, then You're what everyone thinks you are.
Just a kid who has no idea what she's doing.
It's not easy out there, Nance.
I know.
People are always saying you can't.
That you shouldn't.
That you're not...
smart enough, not good enough.
This world, it...
it beats you up again and again until eventually, I...
Most people, they just...
they just stop trying.
But you're not like that.
You're a fighter.
You always have been.
I honestly don't know where you get it from.
Dad.
I think you were swapped in the hospital, to tell you the truth.
No.
I get it from you, Mom.
I get it from you.
Well, wherever you get it from,
I'm proud of you.
Proud of me for getting fired?
That you stood up for yourself.
That you stood up to those...
shitheads.
Mom!
Yes, those shitheads.
And if you believe in this story...
Look at me, Nancy.
...finish it.
Then go sell it to The Indianapolis Star or whatever and...
I mean, can you imagine their faces
when they read a story about their own town
in a big paper like that?
That would be...
pretty amazing.
So, why not?
Why not?
Finish it.
Uh, Will?
Um, you know, about yesterday...
It's fine, Lucas.
You don't have to say anything.
I know, but it's just...
It was a really cool campaign.
And Mike and I, we should've never I don't care anymore, Lucas.
I really don't.
We have bigger things to worry about now.
This should hold him.
Hey, I found the breakers.
Whoa, that thing is super creepy.
Let me see it.
I think this'll work. Right, buddy?
Right, Mike.
Hey, El...
I just wanted to say...
You know when I said Nana was sick?
She wasn't. I lied.
I know. Right, right, right. No, I just...
think it was important for you to know the context.
Hopper, he went all crazy on me,
telling me I'm spending way too much time with you.
He made me lie. I mean,
you're the most important thing to me in the world.
What if he's right?
What? Hop.
No, no, no, no.
He's just some angry old man who hates joy.
But if I only see you,
and I'm a different species than you,
then I should be with my species more.
What are you talking about?
Did you spy on me?
That's totally against the rules. I make my own rules.
Mike, are you there? Yeah!
Where are you guys? I'm coming. Just...
hold on a second.
Shit!
God, I hope it's not you.
I really hope it's not you.
Erica, do you copy?
Mmhmm. I copy.
You nerds in position or what? Yeah, we're in position.
It's all quiet here, so you've got the green light.
Green light, roger that.
Commence Operation Child Endangerment.
Can we maybe not call it that?
See you on the other side.
Nerds.
Winnie!
Winnie, is that you?
Larry? Winnie, upstairs in the bedroom!
Baby.
Oh, my God, baby, what happened?
Get me a phone.
Baby Get me a goddamn phone!
Anything?
No.
This place is dead.
All right, where to next?
Hess Farm.
All right, nerds.
I'm there.
Do you Do you see anything?
Yeah, I see those boring boxes you're so excited about.
Any guards? Negative.
Booby traps? If I could see them,
they'd be pretty shit traps,
wouldn't they? Thank you for that.
I'm in.
Oh, God.
Free ice cream
for life.
Pool's closed.
Hey.
Do you hear me?
Pool is closed!
Billy!
Who's there?
Billy!
Who's there?
Billy!

You think this is funny, huh?
Billy.
Come and find me.
I find you, it is your funeral.
Come and get me. Come on!
Billy!
Got you.
Come and get me, you piece of shit.
Hey.
Behind you.
Hi.

Come on. Got it.
Max.
Do it.
Hi.
Uh, I'm here to see Doris Driscoll.
I think she was admitted last night.
Name and relation?
Uh... Nancy...
Driscoll.
I'm...
Nancy Driscoll.
Her... granddaughter.
That's definitely not Chinese food.
Uh, maybe you guys should, you know, stand back.
No. Just...
Just step back, okay? No.
Step back. Seriously. No! No!
If you die, I die.
Okay.
What the hell?
What is that?
Was that just me, or did the room move?
Booby traps.
You know what? Let's just grab that and go.
Which one do I press, Erica?
Just press the damn button, nerd.
Which one? I'm pressing the button, okay?
"Press ""open door."" I'm pressing ""open door."""
Just open the Press the other button.
Out of the way so she can push the button
Would you stop? I'm trying.
Would you let me just do it? Would you stop?
Just open the door!
Oh, shit.
Max! Let me out of here!
Let me out.
You kids...
You think this is funny?
You kids think this is some kind of sick prank, huh?
You little shits think this is funny?
What is this?
Open the door.
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the goddamn door!
We're at 220.
It's not my fault.
It's not my fault.
It's not my fault, Max.
I promise you, it's not my fault.
What's not your fault, Billy?
I've done things, Max. Really...
bad things.
I didn't mean to.
He made me do it.
Who made you do it?
I don't know, it's like a shadow.
Like a giant shadow.
Please, Max.
What did he make you do?
It's not my fault, okay? Max, please.
Please, believe me, Max, it's not my fault.
I tried to stop him, okay? I did.
Please believe me, Max.
Please believe me.
Billy, it's gonna be okay.
Max, please.
It's gonna be okay.
We want to help you.
We want to help you.
You just have to talk to us, okay?
You have to talk to us.
I believe you, Billy.
We'll figure it out together, okay?
I feel him.
He's activated. I need you to trust me. Please.
Max, get away from the door. What?
Get away from the door!
Let me out, you bitch! Let me out!
I'll fucking gut you!
Let me out!
Max, come on!
Oh, my God.
He can't get out, can he? No way.

Yeah, no shit, Harrington!
Why don't these buttons work?!
Press the button!
What do you think I'm doing?!
Come on, press something! Just press the button!
Push it!
Oh!
My groin.
It fell on my groin.
Dustin!
Get this off of me!
I can't move.
Is everyone okay?
Yeah, I'm great, now that I know that Russians can't design elevators!
I think we've clearly established that those buttons don't work.
They're buttons. They have to do something.
Yeah, if we had a keycard.
A what? It's an electronic lock.
Same as the loading dock door. If we don't have a keycard,
it won't operate, meaning We're stuck in here.
Yeah.
Just so you nerds are aware,
I'm supposed to be spending the night at Tina's,
and Tina always covers for me.
But if I'm not home for Uncle Jack's party tomorrow
and my mom finds out you three are responsible,
she's gonna hunt you down, one by one, and slit your throat.
I don't care about Tina!
Or Uncle Jack's party!
Your mom's not gonna be able to find us if we're dead in a Russian elevator!
Hey.
What if we climbed out?
What were you saying about climbing?
Looks like somebody's home.
Did you hear that?
Where's that coming from?
It's below us.
Hey, dipshits!
Hawkins PD. Hands in the air.
Don't make me say it again!
English.
You speak English?
I can't understand you!
I can't understand you.
No understand!
Hopper!
Don't move!
Drop the gun.
Drop it!
You understand what I'm saying, big guy?
Drop the weapon.
Or what?
You going to shoot?
Good.
So you do understand what I'm saying, huh?
And, yeah,
you don't put that thing away, I'm gonna blow some daylight
into that thick skull of yours.
No.
You won't do that.
Why's that?
Because you are policeman.
Policemen have rules.
Oh, yeah?
Wanna test that theory?
I'm gonna count to three.
One,
two,
three!
Hopper!
Oh, shit.
Go!
Move, Joyce!
Oh, God. Come on, Smirnoff.
You're coming with us!
Go, go, go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it, Smirnoff! Move it!
Run!
Joyce! Drive!
Come on, Joyce! Quit screwin' around! Are you kidding me?
Shit! Go!
Joyce, drive.
I'm trying! Joyce, please, drive!
Drive!
Get us outta here!
Oh, God!
Hang on!
Still think it was our government?
God, shut up!
Hello? Jonathan.
Do you realize what time it is?
Listen to me, okay?
It's 6:00 a.m. and, uh, I had a late night with Fagin and the gang, so
I'm at the hospital with Driscoll. What?
She's been sedated for a few hours and the doctors are still running tests.
Nancy, please tell me you're joking.
It's not a joke. And, yes, I know I'm insane
and irrational and out of touch, but can you save your lecture,
because I really don't give a shit right now. I just...
I need you to put me on the phone
with your brother.
What? Jonathan...
Please.
Uh...
He's not even here.
Where is he?
Is he safe?
Why wouldn't he be safe?
Nancy?
Why wouldn't he be safe?
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch!
Okay, a magnet? Magnets?
"Do you know ""magnet""? Magnet? Magnit."
Yes, magnit.
Okay, so, uh, magnit...
on my my fridge,
my icebox, and then they...
they fell.
They demagnetized, stopped working. Uh, do you understand?
Da.
Okay, so is that because of the machines that you're working on?
Machina. Machina, machina, yes.
Da, da, machina.
Machina, machina! Yes, machina
Vroom, vroom.
Oh, not not the car.
The machines at Hess Farm where
where we kidnapped you Joyce, please!
You're givin' me a headache, both of you!
Hold on, please. One minute.
Hey.
I am making progress.
Progress. Yeah.
What have you learned, huh? You learned that Smirnoff over there
Alexei. Smirnoff is Russian
and works for Starcourt,
two things we already knew.
Thought we knew.
But now we knowknow, because I've confirmed them.
You're welcome.
Yeah? Why don't you confirm whether this baby'll start, huh?
Keep it in park, please. Yeah, duh!
You do do something useful.
You do something useful.
It's not working.
Try it again.
Shit.
Hey. Hey.
Stop, stop!
Shut up, Smirnoff!
Aw, come on! D'you hear me?
I said shut your damn
Shit!
Oh, Jesus.
Whoa!
Stop.
I thought this friend of yours lived in Illinois.
He's not really a friend. He's more like an acquaintance.
Oh? Okay, well
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Keep up, keep up, keep up.
Easy.
Okay, so this acquaintance...
lives in Illinois? Correct? Yeah, yeah.
So we're walking to Illinois?
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna walk to Illinois.
You know, I figure we'll get there by, like, Friday evening.
I hope that works for your schedule. Jesus Christ, Joyce.
We're not walking to Illinois, okay? Well, then what are we doing?
I don't know, okay?
I will I will figure something out.
Isn't there someone in Indiana who speaks Russian that
You know what? I'm all ears, Joyce.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears!
I mean, fine.
Just saying.
Gah!
Ugh!
Gah!
Damn it.
I found him.
Where is he?
Woods.
Woods?
He's with... Will's mom.
My My mom?
What are they doing?
Ill... annoy.
They're going to Illannoy.
Mike! Breakfast!
Not now, Mom!
Illinois? Illinois, like the state?
The state of Illinois?
Illannoy.
Does it still hurt?
Only when I talk.
Well, it's a good thing you're not Mike, then.
"""Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."" And you'd be in constant pain."
Something's not right. I can't get Hopper off my back all summer,
now all of a sudden, he's hiking with Will's mom to Illinois?
And Dustin's MIA, too?
I mean, this can't be a coincidence.
What does it matter?
The bottom line is, they're not here.
It's up to us. Up to us to do what exactly?
Find Billy and stop him.
Okay, yeah, that's a really nice sentiment,
but even if El could find him again, and that's a pretty big if, then what?
We burn the shit out of him and make sure he doesn't escape this time.
Okay, then what? Then we win.
No, see, that's the problem.
We don't. We don't win.
We got the Mind Flayer out of Will before and he just came right back.
We don't just have to stop Billy, we have to stop the Mind Flayer.
How in the hell do we do that? I don't know.
Maybe El does.
What are they still doing in there?
I don't know.
Girls just like hanging out in bathrooms.
Why?
I mean, I don't know. They're conspiring against me.
That's what you're concerned about now? It's not my main concern.
It's just a subconcern. I thought it was already over.
It's not over, okay? We're just taking a break.
She said she dumped your ass.
That doesn't sound like a break. It wasn't!
You guys do realize we can still hear everything you're saying, right?
Conspiring.
I told you, they're conspiring.
Not now, Mom!
Mike, open the door.
Code red, I repeat, code red.
Does anyone copy?
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red.
This is a code red, I repeat, a code red. Does anyone copy?
We are innocent children and we are trapped under Starcourt Mall.
The Red Army has infiltrated Hawkins, and if we are found,
they will torture and kill us.
Hey.
Gotta take it easy on that thing. Gonna drain the battery.
The mall just opened. So?
So someone could be in range.
What do you think, Petey the Mall Cop is gonna rappel down here
and save the day?
All right, why are you such a cranky pants
after getting to spend the night with Robin?
Shh! Jesus Christ.
Will you just give up on your creepy dream already?
I heard you guys talking all night.
We were trying to figure out a way to open up the door
while you children were sleeping.
After eight hours,
we're still exactly nowhere, which is,
you know, probably just a little bit of the reason why I'm feeling just...
a tad cranky.
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm taking a leak. Look away.
Look away!
Can you redirect your stream, please?
Ugh.
Hey, hey! Be careful, careful, careful!
We don't even know what that is.
Exactly. It could be useful.
Useful how?
We can survive down here a long time without food,
but if the human body doesn't get water, it will die.
I hate to break it to you,
but this is not water.
No, but it's a liquid,
and if it comes down to me drinking that shit
or dying of thirst,
I drink.
.
We've got company.
You smell that?
What?
Piss.
Let's go.
Go. Go, go, go, go, go. I'm going!
Henderson. Go, go.
Come on, Steve, let's go!
Jesus Christ. Ooh!
You still wanna drink that?
Holy mother of God.
Well...
hope you guys are in good shape.
Looking at you, roast beef.
Let's go, come on.
Why me?
It was the same thing,
the exact same thing that happened to Will last year.
And look at this. Look at the body temperatures.
He likes it cold.
Okay, so this crazy old woman who was eating fertilizer
Mrs. Driscoll. Right, yeah, Mrs. Driscoll.
What time was this attack? Last night.
Right, but what time last night?
Around 9:00. You waited all night to call?
I was waiting for the doctors to run some tests.
You weren't there?
Well, I'm here now, aren't I?
Hallelujah!
Ooh.
Um, so, wha what time was your... sauna test?
Around 9:00.
Well, that proves it. That proves my theory.
She's flayed, just like Billy.
Flayed? The Mind Flayer. He flays people.
Takes over their mind.
Once they do that, they basically become him.
If there are two flayed We have to assume there are more.
Heather.
Billy was doing something to her.
She was scared.
She was screaming.
Bad screams.
What's a good scream? Max said
Doesn't matter. I'm sorry, I'm lost. Who is Heather?
She's a lifeguard at the pool. Heather Holloway?
Tom.
Seriously?
Welcome to my world.
Seat belts.
Oh, my God. Can you not walk so close? What?
Can you not walk so close to me? You stink.
I get it, I get it. You're upset, right?
'Cause I, uh... I blew up the car?
Yeah, with me in it.
Well, I just want to remind you of something, Joyce.
I am not a mechanic. Yeah, clearly.
That's why you should've listened to Alexei.
Oh, right, yeah. Your new boyfriend, right?
Yes. Every man I talk to from now on has to be my boyfriend.
Yeah, he reminds me a bit of a Russian Scott Clarke.
Oh, here we go.
Maybe you should go on a date. I don't know, I'm thinking, like, Enzo's?
Whoa. What?
He's running.
You son of a bitch!
Hey! Smirnoff!
Get back here!
Hey! C'mere!
Hey, c'mere!
You all gonna pay for those?
So, what are you, some kinda bounty hunter?
I'm a cop.
I'm undercover.
Oh, hey, Karen, it's Joyce.
Yeah, I I'm just checking on Will.
At the movies?
Just keep your mouth shut, all right?
All right, all right, hop in. Come on, get in.
Hey! Hey!
"You ""hey!"" You ""hey!"""
This is a police emergency, all right?
I need to commandeer your vehicle.
What?
As long as there's a... a...
What is your name, sir?
Todd. Todd?
Yeah. Todd.
Todd. Todd...
listen to me.
That man in there,
I know he doesn't look it,
but he is one of the most dangerous men in the world.
He's, uh...
murdered many children. What?
Yeah, he's a true psychopath. I tracked him over two state lines.
Hey, what's going on?
Ah, Detective Byers.
Uh...
this is Todd.
He's agreed to... lend us his vehicle to transport our dangerous criminal.
Oh, yes, he very dangerous, uh,
forger... er.
Yeah. Uh, child murderer.
Child murderer? We should really get going.
Hey, how do I get my car back?
You just call the station. What station?
Ooh, I like the sound of that, Todd!
Hey, what station?
You're doing the right thing!
Hey, what the... Hey!
Dude!
I mean, you have to admit, as a feat of engineering alone,
this is impressive.
What are you talking about? It's a total fire hazard.
There's no stairs, there's no exit,
there's just an elevator that drops you halfway to hell.
They're Commies.
You don't pay people, they cut corners.
To be fair to our Russian comrades,
I don't think this tunnel was designed for walking.
Think about it, they developed the perfect system
for transporting that cargo.
It all comes into the mall like any old delivery.
And then they load it up onto those trucks and nobody's the wiser.
You think they built this whole mall
so they could transport that green poison?
I very seriously doubt it's something as boring as poison.
It's gotta be much more valuable, like promethium or something.
What the hell is promethium?
It's what Victor Stone's dad used to make Cyborg's bionic and cybernetic components.
You're all so nerdy, it makes me physically ill.
No, no, no. No, don't lump me in with them.
I'm not a nerd, all right?
Why so sensitive, Harrington?
Afraid of losing cool points to a tenyearold child?
No, I'm just saying I don't know jack shit about Prometheus.
Promethium.
Prometheus is a Greek mythological figure, but whatever. All I'm saying is,
it's probably being used to make something.
Or power something.
Like a nuclear weapon? Totally.
Walking towards a nuclear weapon. That's great.
That'd be great. But if they're building something,
why here?
I mean, Hawkins. Seriously. Of all places.
At the very best, we're a toilet stop on your way to Disneyland,
but maybe that's it. Maybe it's our very...
You think the Russians know? About
They could. So it's connected?
Maybe. How?
I don't know, but it's...
Possible.
I'm sorry, is there something you'd like to share with the class?
Walkie.
"""A trip to China sounds nice."
"If you tread lightly."""
It's the code.
Wherever that broadcast is coming from It's close.
And if there's one thing we know about that signal...
It can reach the surface.
Let's go.
Tom?
Heather?
Jesus, it's freezing.
Do you guys smell that?
Oh.
Oh, God.
More chemicals.
You think they're guzzling this shit?
Yeah, either that or they just went on a hell of a cleaning spree.
But last year, Will didn't eat chemicals.
Did you? No.
This is something new.
Mr. Clarke, fifth grade. Posit.
What happens when you mix chemicals together?
You create a new substance.
What if they're making something? In themselves?
I mean, come on, if you drink this crap, it'll kill you.
Yeah, if you're human.
Blood.
Yesterday,
Tom had a bandage on his forehead.
He was attacked.
Call 91
They must have tied them.
They must have taken them somewhere.
Mrs. Driscoll.
She kept saying...
"""I have to go back."""
What if the flaying,
it's taking place somewhere else?
There must be a place where all this started, right?
A source.
Somewhere he didn't want me to see.
If we can find the source, then maybe we can stop him.
Or at least stop it from spreading
or doing whatever the hell he's doing with those chemicals.
How do we find it?
Mrs. Driscoll.
If she wants to go back so badly, why don't we let her?
...this guy comes up to me,
I'm just pumping gas over here,
and he Hey, whoa!
Don't cross me right now!
Busy day?
You could say that.
Some psycho stole that dude's car.
What else?
What? What else did he say?
This psycho?
No offense, but I already went over all this with the cops.
I'm not a cop.
Yeah, no shit, Khrushchev.
Oh, shit!
Don't look at them.
At me.
Tell me
about this psycho.
Come on, let's go.
Move it.
I thought you said this guy was a journalist.
Yeah, he, uh... he was.
Was?
Look at the camera.
The camera, above you to the right.
Identify yourselves.
Jim Hopper, Joyce Byers,
Smirnoff.
Alexei. Alexei.
Surname.
I don't know.
Family name!
Yeah, I know. I told I don't know, okay?
Open the damn door!
Hopper.
It's all right. Don't worry.
He's a little bit eccentric, but...
he's completely harmless.
Name.
Get that out of my face,
you bald American pig.
I may be bald,
but you're the one in handcuffs,
Soviet scum.
Hi, Jim.
Wait.
Watch it.
Silence, scum.
How long is this gonna take, because I No.
No. No.
No, you do not get to question me.
You have dragged an enemy of the state into my home
as carelessly as a child drags in shit on his shoe.
I will search him until I am satisfied.
Jim. C'mere.
Just c'mere. I need to talk to you.
Yeah, what?
What? This is not gonna work.
What do you mean? He's not eccentric, he's certifiable.
Glass houses, Joyce. What?
You know, pot calling the kettle black. Oh, come on.
Excuse me! What?
Do me a favor and move your lovers' quarrel elsewhere.
Oh, oh, this? No, no, no.
Not a lovers' quarrel, pal.
Spare me!
What is your problem?
Please, stop talking!
No! We have had a very long day.
We have been shot at, nearly blown up,
walked God knows how many miles in a hundred degree heat,
stole a car,
all while being chased by this gigantic... psychopath,
all so we could bring him to you.
Because somehow, you're the closest person who speaks Russian,
which I can't believe.
But that doesn't matter because, unfortunately, we're here.
So, if you don't mind,
put that thing away,
stop behaving like a jackass, and ask him what he's doing
that's making my magnets fall off my damn fridge!
Please.
Okay, clear.
Clear, come on, let's go.
Okay, that was close.
Too close. Relax.
All right? Relax. Nobody saw...
Shit.
Jesus!
Red Dawn. I saw it.
First floor, northwest. Saw what?
The comms room.
You saw the comms room?
Correct.
Are you sure? Positive. The door was open for a second,
and I saw a bunch of lights and machines and shit in there.
That could be a hundred different things.
I'll take those odds.
All right.
We're gonna move fast, we're gonna stay low.
Okay? Okay.
Shh!
Move it.
Let's go.
Sh, sh. Come on.
Tread lightly!
Tread lightly!
Who are you?
Silver cat... Silver cat.
I don't understand.
China?
Dude!
You did it!
You won a fight!
Jeez...
What are you doing? Getting us our ticket out of here.
You want to walk all the way back?
Well, we can hang out for a little bit, relax, have a picnic maybe.
Have a picnic? We came here for the radio.
This plan is way better. If I knew Steve could knock out a Russian,
that would've been our plan in the first place.
...but I guess you're Guys.
There's something up there.
Let's go.
Holy shit.
No, that is not mean.
That is honest.
She won't find out.
See, you're the only one who gon' tell Whoa, whoa, whoa! Excuse me!
Where do you think you're going?
Oh, um...
I was just going to visit my grandma again.
And And this...
this is my family.
Extended. I don't care who they are.
You know the rules. Two visitors at a time.
Yeah, but Two!
Girl, this child has lost her mind.
She brought a whole zoo in here.
You know,
those things that I said yesterday, I...
I didn't mean them.
I know. I don't think you're like those assholes.
At all.
I never have. I...
I was just Angry?
Which I still don't get.
I mean, I was just completely, utterly,
mortifyingly...
wrong.
Don't let that go to your head.
I won't.
I just look forward to you never doubting me again.
Oh, come on, you piece of shit!
Thanks.
Dude, I think that was it.
That was what?
The olive branch.
The what?
Oh, my God.
You're hopeless.
Okay,
I'll distract Max,
get you an opening.
And then talk to her. All right?
Where is she?
I don't know.
Are you sure this is the right room? Yeah.
She's gone home.
We were hoping you might come back.
Whose blood is that?
Tom, whatever you've done, it's not you.
He's making you do this.
Go!
Owie.
Go, go, go!
Run!
Yeah!
Got it, two in a row. That was good, that was good.
Best three in a row now. Hey.
Hi.
Does your species like M & M's?
I like the new look, by the way. It's cool.
Thanks.
Run!
This way, this way!
Nancy!
Hello? Hello?!
Here.
It's ringing.
I don't care how good her pie is.
No, I don't want her in my damn house.
Come on, pick up!
Nancy?
Hi there.
I'm here for you, Nancy Drew.
No!
Jonathan!
You bitch. Nancy!
Run!
Help! Help!
Help!
Is anyone here?!
Nancy.
Nancy!
Where are you going?
Yoohoo.
Nancy Drew, where are you?
Nancy.
Marco...
Marco...
Polo!
Huh?
Go... to... hell!
The gate.
I don't understand. You've seen this before?
Not exactly. Then what, exactly?
All you need to know is it's bad. It's really bad.
Like, endofthehumanraceasweknowit kind of bad.
And you know about this how?
Um, Steve? Where's your Russian friend?
Shit.
Halt! Halt!
Shit.
Go, go, go, go, go! Shit.
Move! Let's move!
Go! Shit! Shit, shit, shit!
Go, go, go!
Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!
Holy shit! Holy shit! Shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!
Holy shit!
Guards! Go! This way!

Shit! This way!
Come on, quick! Hold the door!
Robin!
Shit!
Help me, come on! Here! Come on, let's go!
Come on! Go! Just get out of here!
Go, come on, now!
No! Just go get some help, okay?
What are you doing?!
Go!
I won't forget you!
Go!
He's here.
Shit. Nancy!
Run!
Damn!
Hey!
Come on!

Hey, hey, hey! Two at a time!
Oh, my God.

What what are you doing? What's what's this doing here?
What? Your stand.
It's right in the main thoroughfare.
Where do you want it, sir?
Over there with the rest of the goddamn food stalls.
It isn't rocket science.
Sheesh, do I have to do everything myself?
My friends in state PD,
highway patrol, they're all on the lookout.
I got eyes everywhere.
The second he pops up...
I get a call.
A call?
Yes. A call.
I mean, what more do you people want me to do?
We want you to find him.
Let me explain something to you.
This man is a moron, okay?
He's driving around in a yellow convertible, for Christ's sakes.
He sticks out like a sore thumb.
I will find him.
And, when I do,
may I suggest you bring some backup with you this time?
Backup. Some comrades.
Since last time, he got the better of you.
Please...
I I didn't mean that.
You You don't need backup.
This man is your fault,
your problem.
You're lucky you still breathe.
Very lucky.
Please.
I'm sorry.
I I have a bad temper.
I'm going to therapy.
You have one day to find this man for me.
Nod if you understand.
Two Whoppers,
extra ketchup, large fry,
pack of Marlboro Reds,
and one extralarge...
Slurpee.
Burger King is nowhere near the 7Eleven, by the way.
Never said it was.
Let's try this again. Joyce.
Alexei,
the generators,
what are they powering?
And tell him that we know it is not the Starcourt Mall,
so he can stop selling us that crap.
Those generators you were working on, what are you powering?
We know it's not the mall.
This tastes like shit strawberry.
What'd he say? He says,
"""It's strawberry."""
I'm sorry?
His... Slurpee.
He says it's strawberry.
So what?
Hop, he did ask for cherry. I mean...
Well, they didn't have cherry.
They didn't have it.
And it doesn't matter,
because it all tastes the same, okay?
It is sugar on ice. You tell him that.
Tell him what?
You tell him that it all tastes the goddamn same!
It's all the same.
Sugar on ice. No difference.
Tell that stupid man it is not the same in the slightest,
and I would like the cherry I requested.
He respectfully disagrees.
It's not the same at all,
and he would like...
cherry.
Oh, yeah? You tell him... he can forget it.
He says forget it. No cherry.
No cherry, no deal.
He says,
"""No cherry..."
"no deal."""
Yeah.
Hm.
Mm.
Oh, shit!
No, Hop
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I'm not gonna hurt him! What are you doing?
Come on! Come on!
I'm just giving him an opportunity
to get his own damn...
cherry Slurpee!
Jim, that man is an enemy of the state.
Yeah, who's been jerking us around for a full day!
I get him his cherry Slurpee, then what?
He wants a helicopter to charter him to his own private island.
I have dealt with assholes like this
my entire life.
Yesterday in the woods, he could've escaped,
but he didn't.
He stuck with us.
Why do you think that is?
It's because...
he's scared.
He's scared.
Not of us,
of them.
He's scared of that sevenfoottall Russian freak
who could've killed him just as easily as us.
Smirnoff knows
that if he runs back to his comrades without a scratch on him,
they're gonna think that he spilled his guts.
So, whether he likes it or not, we...
are the best chance he's got.
Ooh!
I give him 30 seconds before he comes knocking on that door,
right back into our arms,
with a new sense of humility.

So, when we set fire to the hub,
we drew the Demodogs away so El could close the gate.
But now, for some insane reason,
the Russians appear to be trying to reopen it,
which just destroys everything we risked our lives for.
"By ""we,"" you're including Lucas?"
Yes, of course.
So, all that shit you told me, Lucas was there?
Yeah. My brother, Lucas Charles Sinclair?
Yes!
I don't believe you.
Wait, so you believe everything about El and the gate
and the Demodogs and the Mind Flayer,
but you question your brother's involvement?
That's correct.
Makes total sense.
Um, you need help with that? No.
Well, I mean, it's taking a while, so Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
All right, so if we don't find a more efficient method to stop these fans,
we're never gonna find help, and your ice cream buddies are screwed.
Yeah, with that attitude, they are. Jeezus!
I'm just being realistic.
I mean, we've made it about pointthree miles in nine hours.
Then we had to walk three hours down that tunnel,
so I'd estimate ten miles back to the elevator,
which should take us approximately twelveandahalf days.
Did you just do all of that in your head?
I'm good with numbers.
Holy shit. You're a nerd.
Come again?
You... are... a... nerd.
Okay, you better take that back, nerd. Can't put the truth back in the box.
But it's not the truth. Let's examine the facts, shall we?
Fact one: you're a math whiz, apparently.
That was a pretty straightforward equation.
Fact number two: you're a political junkie.
Just because I don't agree with Communism as an ideology
Fact number three: you love My Little Pony.
And what does My Little Pony have to do with this?
Ah, let's recall the ponies' latest adventure, shall we?
The evil centaur team and Tirek
turns Applejack into a dragon at Midnight Castle,
and then Megan and the other ponies have to use Moochick's magic
to defeat his rainbow of darkness,
saving them from a lifetime of enslavement.
All the pink in the world can't disguise the irrefutable fact
that centaurs and castles and dragons and magic
are all standard nerd tropes.
Ergo, My Little Pony is nerdy.
Ergo, you, Erica,
are a nerd.
And how do you know so much about My Little Pony?
Because I'm...
a nerd.
Let's go...
nerd.
You...
That one stung.
Who do you work for?
For the millionth time, I work at Scoops Ahoy!
Scoops Ahoy.
What the hell?!
Look at my outfit!
Look at my outfit!
You think I just wear this?! Think I'm a spy in a sailor's uniform?
How did you get in?
I already told you.
I told you before.
My delivery didn't come,
and my friends and I, we thought that it was left at the loading dock,
so we went in the room, and then it turned into an elevator,
and then... and then we dropped and then,
next thing we know, I open my eyes,
and we're in this...
wonderful facility.
But I swear to God,
nobody knows about us, nobody saw us.
You could just let us go, all right?
And I'm not gonna tell anybody about this, okay?
Shit happens, life goes on.
And, uh... ice ice cream.
Ice cream, okay?
You guys know what ice cream is. Everybody loves ice cream.
I don't know if you have Russian ice cream or if that's considered gelato.
I don't know what's what, but whatever you guys want, seriously.
USS Butterscotch, I mean, you gotta try it.
It is out of this world, I'm telling ya!
I like this guy!
"""USS... Butterscotch."""
Who do you work for?
Oh, come on. No, no! No, seriously
Get your hands off me!
Hey...
Steve?
Steve? Steve?
Steve?
What did you do to him? What did you do?
Put them in the chairs.
Don't touch me!
Steve
Steve, wake up. Steve?
What did you do?!
Don't touch him.
Steve? Steve, can you hear me?
I think your friend need a doctor.
Good thing...
we have the very best.
You are going to regret that, little bitch.
Bastards.
Let us outta here!
Bastards! Let us out! Let us out!
It can't be good for her to be in there for this long.
Mike, you need to relax.
What if she gets brain damage or something?
Oh, shit. Is that, like, a real thing? No, it's not. He made it up.
Mike doesn't know what he's talking about.
Oh, and you do? No, I...
Yes, from The Hawkins Post.
I I called a couple days ago about the
Yes, yes, um...
I was just... following up to see if anything else had gone missing,
or if Okay.
Um, sorry to bother
[Max and Mike argue indistinctly in background]
Who's next? There is no next.
Unless you want to start calling random people's homes.
It doesn't make sense. What part of any of this makes sense?
There's a pattern, okay? A consistency to their behavior.
They've been feeding on these chemicals since this started,
and and, what, they just stop, out of the blue?
Maybe they have all the chemicals they need.
Maybe they've all turned into those... things.
But what about the source?
I mean, did the Mind Flayer just suddenly stop infecting people?
And even if the flayed are monsters now, why can't El find them?
Okay, can you guys settle an argument for us?
Who do you think should decide El's limits?
Mike or Eleven?
The way that you frame that is such bullshit.
It's not bullshit, Mike. This is your whole problem.
And it's also precisely the reason why she dumped your ass.
El dumped you?
Yeah, because she is conspiring against me.
She's corrupting her.
No, enlightening her.
The fact is, she's not yours.
She's her own person, fully capable of making her own decisions.
She's risking her life for no reason.
For no reason?
Mike, the flayed are out there doing God knows what.
Killing, flaying... Transforming into monsters.
And El's not stupid.
She knows her abilities better than any of us.
Exactly, thank you. And she is her own person.
Exactly. With her own free will.
Exactly.
El has saved the world twice, and Mike still doesn't trust her.
You wanna talk about trust, really? After you made Eleven spy on us?
Wait, what? Oh, she didn't tell you this?
No. Your girlfriend used El's powers
to spy on us. No, no, no, I did not make her.
It was her idea.
And why are we even talking about this, seriously?
Yeah, who cares?
I care. Yeah.
I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy. We were just joking around.
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was taking a massive shit or something?
You weren't. But what if I was?
Then gross! Seriously, Mike?
I'm just trying to demonstrate how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.
In fact, how careless all of you are.
You're treating her like some kind of machine when she's not a machine,
and I don't want her to die looking for the flayed
when they've obviously vanished off the face of the Earth.
So can we please just come up with a new plan
because I love her and I can't lose her again.
What's going on?
Nothing. Nothing.
Just a family discussion.
Oh.
I found him.
Found who?
He calls it the key, and this key emits a great energy.
It requires much strength, power.
Those houses, like the one you found,
they're located near, uh, transformers.
They're stealing from your town's power grid.
Why build this key here? Why are they not doing this in their own backyard?
What are they trying to do, blow us to smithereens?
There were many of these, uh, keys before in Russia,
but they turned out wrong.
They had to come to where the... where the, uh...
Where the what?
I don't understand what he's saying. I thought you were fluent.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are my free translation services not good enough for you?
Because you can just go ahead and file your complaint
right up my ass!
What is Smirnoff doing?
He's showing me.
Oh, okay.
Uh, he says the straw,
they're using it to penetrate a hole
in... a box?
Okay, sorry, sorry.
The straw represents the key, which emits a great energy.
They're using this energy...
to break through a barrier,
to open...
a doorway.
A doorway between worlds.
But it seems this key was only half the equation.
Location Location was the other half.
Oh, what
In Hawkins, this door had been opened once.
It was still...
healing.
Jesus Christ.
So, this door is open now?
He says it is...
opening.
Where are you going? To call our children.
Can we watch Looney Tunes now?
Nyet.
Can I help you with something? Whiskey.
You have whiskey? No, but I do have vodka.
Oh!
If there's a way to start this key, there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?
Turn it off?
Right. Right?
The key, is there a way to turn it off?
"He says, ""Of course he could turn it off. Could..."
"Edison not turn off a lamp, could Bell not hang up a phone?"""
"Cocky bastard. ""But..."""
But what?
But he is now...
"""naked."""
"Sorry, ""exposed."" Compromised."
Hey, I will get you there.
I will get you to your key.
You wanna ask him what the hell's so funny about that?
He says he likes your courage.
You remind him of a...
...fat Rambo.
But he says that even thin Rambo couldn't get there.
This key, it is in an underground fortress
designed by the greatest Russian minds,
guarded by their greatest warriors.
Breaking in is...
impossible.
Jackpot.
Ohhoho!
Do you even know how to drive?
How hard can it be? Max did it.
Aw, come on. You seriously thought
they'd just leave keys in there? There's gotta be a spare.
Hey, Dustin? Yeah?
How big did you say that Demogorgon was?
Big. Nine feet or so. Why?
Found 'em.
Erica?
What the hell is that?!
A deadly weapon.
Could be useful.
For what? What do you think?
Taking down Commies, saving your friends.
Thought you were more realistic than that, nerd.
We don't even know where they are,
and even if we did, there are a million guards up there
with weapons way deadlier than that.
The best thing we can do for them is to get out of here and find help.
Easy with that.
Our chance of surviving, and theirs, rises substantially.
Just trust me on this. Please?
Help!
Help!
Help! Hey, would you stop yelling?
Steve! Oh, my God!
Steve...
Are Are you okay?
My ears are ringing, and I can't really breathe,
my eye feels like it's about to pop out of my skull,
but, you know, apart from that, I'm doing pretty good.
Well, the good news is that they're calling you a doctor.
Is this his place of work?
I love the vibe.
Charming.
Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay,
do you see that table over there to your right? No, your other right.
Oh. Yeah, okay.
And do you see those scissors? Uhhuh.
Yeah, well, I think that if we move at the same time, we could get over there,
and then maybe I could kick the table and knock them into your lap.
And I could cut the binds. Yeah, and we could get out of here.
Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that. Yeah.
Those morons. They left scissors in here?
Yeah, morons. Total morons.
Okay. Okay, so,
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.
Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha. All right.
One, two, three.
Okay, that worked. Okay.
All right. Uh, let's try again. Right.
One, two, three.
Holy shit, this is gonna work! We're close. Ready?
Okay, one, two, three.
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't cry. Robin.
Are you laughing?
Yeah. Jesus!
I'm sorry!
I'm so sorry. It's just...
I can't believe...
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base
"with Steve ""The Hair"" Harrington."
It's just too trippy, man. We're not gonna die.
We're gonna get out of here, okay?
Just You gotta let me just think for a second.
Do you remember, um, Mrs. Click's sophomore history class?
What?
Mrs. ClickityClackity.
That's what us band dweebs called her.
It was first period,
Tuesdays and Thursdays, so you were always late.
And you always had the same breakfast.
Bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel.
I sat behind you
two days a week for a year.
Mister Funny.
Mister Cool.
The King of Hawkins High himself.
Do you even remember me from that class?
Of course you don't.
You were a real asshole, you know that?
Yeah, I know.
But it didn't even matter.
It didn't matter that you were an ass.
I was still...
obsessed with you.
Even though all of us losers pretend to be above it all,
we still just wanna be popular...
accepted,
normal.
If it makes you feel any better, having those things isn't all that great.
Seriously.
It just baffles me.
Everything that people tell you is important,
everything that people say you should care about, it's all just...
...bullshit.
But I guess you gotta mess up to figure things out, right?
I hope so.
I feel like my whole life has been...
one big error.
Yep.
At least it can't get any more messed up than this.
You know, I wish I'd known you in Click's class.
Yeah? Really, I do.
Maybe you could've helped me pass the class.
Maybe instead of being here, I'd be on my way to college right now.
And I would have no idea
that there were evil Russians beneath our feet,
and I would be happily slinging ice cream with some other schmuck.
Gotta say, though,
I liked being your schmuck.
It was fun while it lasted.
It was.
Where were you two going?
Try telling the truth this time, yes?
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov less painful.
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.
Okay! Wait, wait, wait! What is that thing?
It will help you talk.
Did you even clean that thing?!
What's he doing now?
And that's not normal, right?
Billy staying in his room on the Fourth of July?
No, that's not normal.
He wants us to find him.
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.
If we go to Billy, then the rest of the flayed know where we are.
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.
We won't be surprised.
We'll know that they're coming, and we will kick their flayed butts.
You mean El will kick their butts.
Papa!
No.
Rainbow. Three to the right, four to the left.
Sunflower. Rainbow.
It's too risky. Yeah, and unnecessary.
Killing the flayed won't stop the Mind Flayer.
We have to find out where it's spreading from.
We have to find the source.
Billy knows it.
Billy's been there.
To the source.
Yeah, but It's a trap. I know.
We can't go to Billy,
but I think there's another way.
A way for me to see where he's been.
El, I know you think you have to do this, but you don't.
It's just, you've only done this before once.
And your mom, she loved you,
and wanted you to know what happened.
And Billy's mind is is sick, diseased.
The Mind Flayer is in him.
He can't hurt me.
Not in there.
We don't know that.
Mike.
I need you to trust me.
Yeah.
Just... be careful.
Billy.
Can you hear me?
I want to see.
I want to see what happened.
Something's wrong.
Stop! No! No! No!
No!
El, are you okay?
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
What's going on?
I'm... on a beach.
Okay, I may be dense,
but the last I checked,
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.
What else do you see?
A woman.
She's...
pretty.
I...
I think she's looking at me.
Woo!
Yeah!
You did it!
There's...
a boy.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw that!
That was at least seven feet.
I don't know what it was, but it almost gave me a heart attack.
Ten more minutes?
Yeah, okay, ten more minutes. Okay.
But any longer than that, Dad's gonna be mad, okay?
Okay!
Billy?
Watch out for rip currents!
I know.
It's Billy.
It's California.
It's a memory.
I think I see it.
The source.
Two minutes, Jim.
It's a secure line, but any longer than that and they could trace you.
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.
What?
Philadelphia Public Library.
Uh...
This is Jim Hopper...
uh... police chief, Hawkins.
I got this number from Dr. Sam Owens.
What is your identification code?
Identification code?
You don't know it?
You must be joking.
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.
I got it.
You wrote it down and kept it in your wallet?
"""Antique Chariot."" Listen."
Um, tell Owens that the Russkies are opening the gate.
Now, he'll know what that means.
Not about the Russkies, but about the gate.
Tell him that there's an entrance at Starcourt Mall.
I know how to get in,
but I need backup, a lot of backup.
Have him call me back here at 6186258313.
Your message will be relayed.
So, now what? Now, we, uh...
we wait.
You compromised me, Jim.
You do realize that, don't you? I'm gonna have to relocate.
How long do we wait? As long as it takes.
How can you just sit there being calm?
I am not calm!
Our kids are in danger!
You said they were at the festival!
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!
What are you doing? Joyce?
What are you doing?
Philadelphia Public Library.
Yes, hello.
Uh, this is, uh, Antique Chariot's partner...
Wheelbarrow.
I don't think Antique Chariot
properly conveyed the urgency of our situation.
What are you doing?
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm. No.
Don't you dare patronize me!
I don't know who you are,
if you're some glorified secretary or what,
but if you don't wanna lose your job, here's what's gonna happen.
When I hang up,
you're gonna get up off your ass,
and you're gonna go find Owens and tell him what's going on.
We don't have time to talk about it and neither does he.
He's gotta get to Hawkins, and he's gotta bring his men right now!
Do you understand me?
Yes, yes, ma'am.
Thank you. And good day.
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.
That's one minute too long.
Alexei.
What's going on?
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.
Back to Hawkins. Come on.
Come on.
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.
Do you?
I mean, I... I feel fine.
I feel normal. Yeah, I feel I feel fine.
I kinda feel good.
Wanna know a secret? What?
I like it, too!
I feel good. Morons. They messed up the drug.
They messed it up!
Morons. Hey, morons! Morons!
Moron! Mor Hey!
Whoaoh!
Oh, no. There's definitely something wrong with us.
Something's wrong.
Would now be a good time to tell you that I don't like doctors?
Let's try this again, yes?
Who do you work for?
Scoops.
Scoops Ahoy.
How did you find us?
Totally by accident.
More lies.
What is that shiny little toy? Where you going with that, doc?
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Wait! No! Wait! Wait!
Whoa! There was a code! We heard a code!
Code.
What code?
"""The week is long."
"The silver cat feeds when blue meets yellow in the west."""
Blah, blah, blah.
You broadcast that stupid spy shit all over town,
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,
and we cracked it in a day.
A day!
You think you're so smart,
but a couple of kids who scoop ice cream for a living
cracked your code in a day, and now, people know you're here.
Who knows we are here, little bitch?
Uh, well, Dustin knows.
Hey, Steve?
Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows. Steve!
Dustin Henderson.
It is your small, curlyhaired friend?
Oh, curlyhaired. Great hair. Small. Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah.
Where is he?
He's long gone, you big asshole.
And he's probably calling Hopper,
and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.
They're gonna come in here, commandostyle, guns ablazin',
and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Hey! Henderson!
That's crazy, I was just talking about you.
Oh, my God! Get ready to run.
Hey! Billy, stop!
What the hell is wrong with you? What did we talk about, huh?
You gotta slide!
I know. Wait.
Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it? No.
Well, what then? What?
What did I raise, a pussy for a son?
Leave me alone! Hey!
That's right, run! Like you always do!
Where were you last night? Where were you?
I told you, I was with Wendy. Stop lying to me!
I'm not lying to you! You saw him again, didn't you?
Didn't you?! Get away from me!
I said, get away! You You whore!
Stop it! Bitch!
Don't hurt her! No!
Don't hurt her! You bastard!
Mom!
I don't understand. Why not?
Please, Mom, don't do this.
Please come home.
No. How long? How long?!
I miss you.
Get back here!
Get up! What, are you scared to fight me?
You scared?
Get up and fight me, pussy! Pussy!
Billy, come over here, I want you to meet someone.
This is your new sister. Her name's Maxine.
Max.
Shake her hand. Who's there?
I said, shake her hand. I said, who's there?!
I think I found it.
The source.
Where, El? Where are you?
Brimborn...
Steelworks.
Here. Okay, uh, steelworks, steelworks...
Uh...
Here, steel.
Uh...
Found it. 6522 Cherry Oak Drive.
That's close. El, El, we found it. Get out of there.
Get out.
Mike?
Mike?
Mike?
Mike!
Mike!
He can't hear you.
You shouldn't have looked for me.
Because now I see you.
Now we can all see you.
You...
let us in.
And now...
you are going to have to let us stay.
David, where you going?
David?
Adam!
You're gonna miss it!
Adam!
Don't you see?
All this time,
we've been building it.
We've been building it...
for you.
All that work,
all that pain...
all of it... for you.
And now it's time.
Time to end it.
And we are going to end you.
And when you are gone,
we are going to end your friends.
No! And then we are going to end...
everyone.
Get away!
No!
El, you're okay. It's It's okay.
El.

Now, doesn't that just lift your spirits?
Let's give another big hand for the Hawkins High Marching Band!
I hope you're all having a good time tonight.
Are you having a good time?
I can't hear you!
Are you having a good time?
I want you to know that we spared no expense
to provide you with the very best entertainment that money can buy!
Keep your arms inside.
Uhoh! Dad can't get out now.
Why do you two enjoy torturing me?
Because it's fun. Yeah, Dad, 'cause it's fun!
Oh, here we go.
Oh, boy.
Hoo!
But enough of me blabbering.
Who here wants to see some fireworks?
Come on, now, you can do better than that.
Who here wants to see some fireworks?
Uh, why are we stopping?
Because I slipped Jimmy a five.
You what?
Come on, these are the best seats in the house.
The best seats in the house.
Oh!
Happy Fourth of July!
Whoa!
That was pretty, wasn't it? Yeah.
Yeah.
Mom, the trees.
What, baby? The trees are moving.
Why are you looking at the trees, baby?
The fireworks. Look at the fireworks!
That was a big one, wasn't it?
[fireworks popping and crackling distantly]
He said he was building something.
That it was all for me.
Building something...
Is he talking about the flayed? He must be.
So, he's building an army, just like we thought.
Yeah, but he's not building this army to spread.
He's building it to stop Eleven.
Last year, El closed the gate on him.
I have a feeling that really pissed him off.
Like, royally.
And the Mind Flayer now knows that she's the only thing that can stop him.
But if she's out of the way Game over.
He also said
he was gonna kill all of you.
Yeah, well, that's nice.
Do you guys hear that?
It's just the fireworks.
Billy...
When he told you this, it was here, in this room?
He knows we're here.
Jesus, slow down!
Yeah, what is this, like, the Indy 500?
It's the Indy 300.
No, dingus, it's 500! It's 300!
Let's say a million.
What is wrong with them? I don't know.
Dustin, watch out! Shit!
Oh!
You guys all right back there?
They're fine.
Come on. We gotta go, now.
Come on! Get out! Let's go!
Ow!
We're coming! Here goes nothin'.
This sucks.
Hey! You look like you're surfing! Surfing! Yeah!
Whoa!
They seem drunk. Why would they be drunk?
I'm a natural! Check it out!
Whoop!
Wipeout!
He's burning up. You're burning up.
One sec, one sec. Steve, Steve. God, no.
Ow!
His pupils are super dilated.
Maybe he's drugged.
Ugh. Boop!
Steve, are you drugged?
How many times, Dad?
I don't do drugs. It's only marijuana.
This isn't funny, okay? I need to know what they did to you.
Are you gonna die on us? Boop.
We all die, my strange little child friend.
It's just a matter of how...
and when.
They're gonna be looking for us up there,
so I need you to tell me where you parked your car.
Oh, can we make a pit stop at the food court?
I would kill for a hot dog on a stick. Ooh!
All right. Yeah, food.
Yes, you can have as much food as you want,
but only if you tell me where your car is parked.
Uhoh. Uhoh?
The car's off the board.
What? They took the keys.
The Russians, they took the keys.
Like, forever ago.
That's a bummer, right?
Oh!
Oh, my God, that tastes so good. Ah!
Steve, can you taste the air?
I taste it! I taste it!
Stop! Shit! Come on! Come on!
Stop right there!
Okay, okay, okay! Woo! Why are we running?
Yeah. That's good like that.
Hey, get away from the windows.
It's close.
Where'd it go?
Holy shit.
El!
El!
Pull!
Nancy, shoot it!
Come on! Lucas!
Pull!
El! El, you okay?
Go, go, go! Come on, come on, go!
Go! Hurry up! Come on!
Everybody out!
Go! Go, come on!
Go, go, go, go!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Get in. Right here.
Drive! Drive!
Whoa! Where are we going?
Just trust me.
All clear.
Doc!
What did I tell you?!
Eightyeight miles per hour!
Come on.
The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20...
You two, sit. No, no, no! These seats are too close!
Dude, these seats blow. Then don't watch the movie.
We wanna watch it. Then watch it!
Shh! Shh!
Sorry.
Whatever you do,
don't... go... anywhere.
Fine, Dad.
"The appropriate question is ""When the hell are they?"""
You see, Einstein has just become
the world's first time traveler! Sorry. Sorry.
I sent him... into the future!
Okay, it's official.
I'm never having kids.
What are we doing here? We're laying low.
Cooling off.
Like Oswald.
Oswald was found in a theater and shot to death.
A week later.
The point is, his plan didn't work.
Only because it was a setup.
What? He was just a patsy.
Tell me you're joking. Shh!
Shh!
We need to get outta here.
All right, you watch Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
Make sure they don't go anywhere. Where are you going?
To find us a ride.
Look out!
Doc...
What's happening? I have no idea.
Are you telling me that you built a time machine...
What's he saying? He's showing me the location of the key
to turn off the machine.
"Sorry, ""keys."" Two keys."
Twoman rule.
Twoman rule? Yeah, two men, two keys, like a...
nuclear launch.
But, uh, to retrieve the keys, there is a vault.
And to open the vault,
you need to enter Planck's constant.
Planck's what? Planck's constant.
It's a very famous number. All right, so we get the keys,
and then we turn the machine off.
That's what he says.
All right, well, that shouldn't be too hard. We can do this.
Joyce, did you hear the part where he said the place was like
an impenetrable fortress?
Yeah, but there has to be a way in.
Yeah, there is. Our military.
Who are coming. Well, we don't know that anymore
because you yelled at them like it was a parentteacher conference,
and then you hung up on them, so we don't know what the hell's going on,
because now we're Wait, wait, what are we do Oh!
Wait, that's right!
We're on our way to rescue our children
from the big, bad Fourth of July celebration!
You know what, if you can't handle this, then just turn around
and drop me off first.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna walk back to Hawkins?
I will do anything if it gets me away from you!
Children! Children! Children!
This interminable bickering was amusing at first,
but it's getting very stale and we've still got a long drive ahead of us.
So, why don't you two cut the horseshit
and get to the part where you admit your sexual feelings for one another?
Whoa! You are way off base, buddy!
Oh, spare me, spare me, spare me!
Yes, yes, he's a brute. I know.
Probably reminds you of a bad relationship,
and, gosh, you'd really like a nice man to settle down with,
but, admit it, you're real curious to know what he's like in the sack.
And you. Ha!
Well, you're just a big manbaby
who'd rather act tough than show his true feelings,
because the last time you opened your heart, you got hurt.
Owie.
And now, rather than admit these feelings, you're dancing around one another
with this mindnumbing and frankly boorish mating ritual.
So, please, for my sake,
either quit your bickering, or pull over,
tear off those clothes,
and get it over with already!
What was that?
I told them they should have sex.
They have not had sex?
No.
Oh! Oh!
Okay, get her down.
Okay.
Lemme see.
Oh, shit.
What What Hey, what are you doing?
I'm cleaning the wound.
No, first, we need to stop the bleeding,
then clean, then disinfect, then bandage.
I skateboard. Trust me.
Mike, hold this.
Keep the pressure on it, nice and firm, okay?
We're gonna need water, soap.
Yeah, okay. All right.
Does any of this help?
No.
Go get me a washcloth and a bowl.
A bowl? Lucas.
Go. Okay.
What did that thing look like to you?
Like that thing in the hospital, only bigger.
Yeah, a lot bigger.
Like, Tom and Bruce, they merged to become one, right?
And And Driscoll kept saying how she needed to go back to the source
Wait, you think Driscoll's in there?
Maybe.
And And And maybe Heather and Janet, too, and God knows who else.
I don't know how we're gonna kill this thing, but if we do
We kill all the flayed. And... we end this.
Maybe.
All I know is...
we need El.
Bowl...
Bowl...
Bowl...
Why wouldn't it be with the cereal? I don't know.
What else do you use a bowl for?
I I don't know.
Oh, shit.
Satan's Baby.
You ever shot one of these suckers?
No. Is it sweet?
That's an understatement. That doesn't look like a bowl.
Nah, it's way better.
"There is a reason this warning label says ""18 or older."""
This sucker is filled with 150 grains of black powder.
AKA gunpowder.
Strap two of these together, and it's bigger than an M80.
Five of them,
we've got ourselves a stick of dynamite.
You wanna kill that thing with fireworks?
Do you have a better idea?
Uh, yeah. Eleven.
Against that thing? She's gonna need some backup.
Oh, my God.
Hold this.
Does that hurt?
Uh, not bad.
You're gonna have an awesome scar.
You'll look even more badass.
Bitchin'.
Yeah, bitchin'.
El...
Yeah?
I've been meaning to tell you something.
It's just, being broken up,
it's been hard.
And...
I like that you and Max are friends now.
It's just, I was jealous at first, and and angry.
And that's why I said all that stupid stuff.
And it's like I wanted you all to myself.
And now I realize how unfair that is.
And selfish. And, like... I'm sorry.
I just, like, I've never felt like this, you know, with anyone before...
and...
You know, they do say it makes you crazy.
What makes you crazy?
You never You never heard that term...
You know, like the phrase, like...
"""blank makes you crazy,"" like the word..."
"""Girlfriends""? No, no, no, no, not not girlfriends."
"""Boyfriends."" No! No, no, not boyfriends either."
It's like It's like a feeling or... A feeling...
Yeah, like something... Like, old people say it to each other sometimes.
Old people? Yeah.
What I wanna say is...
that I just...
I know that I
I repeat... this is a code red!
Dustin?
Mike?
Dustin! Mike!
Oh, my God, you have to listen. I know I've been MIA,
and I'm sorry, it's not because I'm mad. I mean, I actually was mad,
but it's also because I was trapped underground
in a secret Russian base.
Dustin, you're going way too fast. I can't understand you.
I know that sounds insane, but the Russians have infiltrated Hawkins!
The goddamn Russians!
And now they're using to open the gate.
Dustin, you're you're breaking up.
And now they're after us and we don't have a way out of here,
so I need you to come and get us. Can Nancy drive?
Dustin, you're cutting out.
Mike? Dustin, you there?
Mike? Mike, do you copy?
Dustin
Shit! Not now. Please, not now. Mike!
Dustin! Mike!
What is it?
Do you have any batteries? DoubleA?
Why would I have batteries?
I always carry batteries.
Then what's the problem?
I need eight.
Eight?
Shit. Guess we'll have to go to plan B.
Plan B? What's plan B?
Where... are they?
That's amazing.
So, like, I wasn't totally focused in there or anything, but...
I'm pretty sure...
that mom was trying to bang her son.
Wait, wait, the hot chick was Alex P. Keaton's mom?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
But they're the same age.
No, but he went back in time.
Then why is it called Back to the Future?
He has to go back to the future
because he's in the past.
So, the future is actually the present,
which is his time.
Wh... What?
No, no, it's my turn. You've had enough.
Wow.
Hey, Robin.
You gotta check this out.
Check this...
This... The ceiling, it's beautiful.
Oh, wow.
Oh.
Stay here, go over the plans with Smirnoff.
I can help look. No, you'll scare the children.
Jim, if this is about earlier Stay put, Freud!
You hear me? Stay put!
You know, say what you will about Kline,
he certainly knows how to throw a party.
I'm sorry about him, by the way.
Who, Larry? No, Murray.
He's a sick individual who likes to get under people's skin.
So, let's not let him, you know, get under our skin.
I'm not, I haven't.
I just, you seem a little more quiet than usual.
I just I just wanna find the kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll give it my best shot.
You won yourself a bear!
Thank you. Here you go.
Mayor Kline!
One more, one more.
Big smile. There we go.
Watch it! Happy Fourth, dick.
Come on, come on, come on!
Pick up, pick up, pick up, you commie bastards!
Quiet. Oh, sorry.
How do you even drink that? Because it's delicious.
What?
It's like Carpenter's The Thing.
The original is a classic,
no question about it.
But the remake...
Sweeter, bolder...
better.
You're insane.
So, you prefer the original Thing?
What? No, I'm not talking about The Thing, I'm talking about New Coke.
It's the same concept, dude.
Uh, actually, it's not the same concept.
It is the same concept.
No, it's not. Yes, it is.
Hey.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Did you... find him?
The movies?
Dustin's so freaked out about the gate, he decides to go watch a movie?
Yeah, makes total sense.
"You're positive he said ""gate"" and not ""great""?"
"Yeah, like, ""This movie I'm watching is great."""
"Sounded like ""gate."""
Which would explain how the Mind Flayer's still alive.
Yeah, we just have to shut it again. Then the monster dies.
But if not, we always have Lucas' fireworks.
Keep mocking my plan, Max. Keep mocking it.
I wanna hear you say it again, because you keep doubting me.
You keep doubting me!
Ridiculous. Will?
We're gonna prove 'em wrong, right?
The ceiling stopped spinning for me.
Is it still spinning for you?
Holy shit.
No.
You think we puked it all up?
Maybe. Ask me something.
Interrogate me.
Okay. Interrogate you. Sure.
Um...
When was the last time you, uh, peed your pants?
Today.
What?
When the Russian doctor took out the bone saw.
Oh, my God.
It was just a little bit, though.
Yeah, it's definitely still in her system.
Oh...
All right, my turn. Okay.
Hit me.
Have you...
ever been in love?
Yep. Nancy Wheeler.
First semester, senior year.
Oh, my God.
She's such a priss.
Hm.
Turns out, not really.
Are you still in love with Nancy?
No. Why not?
I think it's because I found someone who's a little bit better for me.
It's crazy.
Ever since Dustin got home, he's been saying,
"""You know, you gotta find your Suzie. You gotta find your Suzie."""
Wait, who's Suzie?
It's some girl from camp, I guess his girlfriend.
To be honest with you, I'm not 100% sure she's even real.
But that's not that's not really the point.
That doesn't matter. The point is, this girl, you know, the one that I like,
it's somebody that I... didn't even talk to in school.
And I don't even know why.
Maybe 'cause Tommy H. would've made fun of me or...
I wouldn't be...
prom king.
It's stupid. I mean, Dustin's right, it's all just a bunch of bullshit anyways.
Because, when I think about it,
I should've been hanging out with this girl the whole time.
First of all, she's hilarious. She's so funny.
I feel like, this summer, I have laughed harder
than I have laughed...
in a really long time.
And she's smart.
Way smarter than me.
You know, she can crack, like, top secret Russian codes and...
You know? She's honestly unlike anyone I've ever even met before.
Robin?
Robin, did you just OD in there?
No.
I...
am still alive.
The floor's disgusting.
Yeah, well, I already got a bunch of blood and puke on my shirt, so...
What do you think?
About?
This girl.
She sounds awesome.
She is awesome. And what about the guy?
I think he's on drugs, and he's not thinking straight.
Really? 'Cause I think he's thinking a lot more clearly than usual.
He's not.
Look...
he doesn't even know this girl.
And if he did know her,
like like really know her,
I don't think he'd even want to be her friend.
No, that's not true. No way is that true.
Listen to me, Steve.
It's shocked me to my core,
but I like you.
I really like you.
But I'm not like your other friends.
And I'm not like Nancy Wheeler.
Robin, that's exactly why I like you.
Do you remember what I said about Click's class?
About me being jealous and, like, obsessed?
Yeah.
It isn't because I had a crush on you.
It's because...
she wouldn't stop staring at you.
Mrs. Click?
Tammy Thompson.
I wanted her to look at me.
But... she couldn't pull her eyes away from you
and your stupid hair.
And I didn't understand, because you would get
bagel crumbs all over the floor.
And you asked dumb questions.
And you were a douchebag.
And And you didn't even like her and...
I would go home...
and just scream into my pillow.
But Tammy Thompson's a girl.
Steve.
Yeah?
Oh.
Oh.
Holy shit.
Yeah.
Holy shit.
Steve...
did you OD over there?
No, I just, uh...
just thinking.
Okay.
I mean, yeah.
Tammy Thompson, you know, she's cute and all, but...
I mean,
she's a total dud.
She is not.
Yes, she is. She wants to be, like, a singer.
She wants to move to, like, Nashville and shit.
She has dreams. She can't even hold a tune.
She's practically tonedeaf. Have you heard her?
All the time.
♪ You see me now tonight ♪
Shut up. ♪ You see me... ♪
She does not sound like that. She sounds exactly
That's a great impersonation of her. She does not.
You sound like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet.
She sounds like a Muppet giving birth.
♪ And if you could hold me tight ♪
♪ We'll be holding on forever ♪
Exactly. I know!
Okay.
What the hell?
And why all this?
If I just turn the keys, it's like turning off a car.
But then the car still works, does it not?
Yes.
And do you want the car to still work or do you want it to explode?
I want the car to explode.
Good. Then do this.
Just make sure you are nowhere near it when it does. It is not pretty.
Turns people into dust.
And then...
It's over.
And I become an American citizen and join in the fun, yes?
Who said you had to be an American to join the fun?
It doesn't get more American than this, my friend.
Fatty foods, ugly decadence,
rigged games...
Fifteen tickets, please.
They are rigged, these games? Yes.
They do not look rigged.
That's just it, my dear Alexei.
They have been designed to present the illusion of fairness!
But it's all a scam, a trick,
to put your money in the rich man's pocket.
That, my dear friend, is...
America.
But, hey...
knock yourself out.
Where are you going?
To get us the closest thing to food I can find.
Hey. Hey.
Karen.
Step right up!
...feel the wind push you back and it's gonna
Hold on. Do we have seat belts? Hey, Karen.
Joyce!
Oh, my gosh! How funny to see you here!
Where are the kids?
I... I haven't seen them. I don't think they're here yet.
You three, up against the wall! No, where are they?
Oh, my gosh, I can hardly keep track these days.
Uh, they were at, uh...
Dustin's, then Lucas's,
then Max's. Max...
You know how it is. Summer!
Probably getting into some kinda trouble.
Last warning, you two. Up against the wall!
Hold the ride!
On your life, Magnum.
Woo! Here we go!
Holy smokes!
Holy smokes!
Roads?
Where we're going, we don't need roads.
And...
blend.
It is so good!
Well, shit, that worked. Course it worked.
We just have to get on the bus with the rest of these plebes,
and home sweet home, here we come.
Uh, Dustin? What?
Yeah, we might not wanna go to your house.
Why?
Well, I might've told them your full name.
What is wrong with you? Dude, I was drugged.
So? So?
So, you resist. You tough it out. You tough it out like a man.
Oh, yeah, it's easy for you to say.
Guys?
Sorry for the inconvenience. Have a pleasant evening.
Abort.
Abort. Abort.
Shit.
Okay.
Come on, let's go, let's go.
That's three green!
And here's dart number four!
One more for the big prize!
You can do it, mister!
We have a winner!
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
Get your tickets right here!
Murray!
Look!
It's not rigged!
Ah!
It's not rigged.
Traitor.
Alexei!
Alexei!
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Let's go.
Easy.
Keep pressure on it.
I'll get you help.
I'll get help.
Jim... Jim.
Jim!
They got Alexei, Jim!
Jim! Alexei! They got Alexei, Jim!
We gotta go.
We gotta go. What?
Let's go.
They make an odd couple, don't they?
Well, it's like they say,
there's someone for everyone.
Who wants a hot dog?
Find Murray, get the car,
bring it around back. Okay.
"Heading to ""Big Top."""
Northeast side of the fair.
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen!
Get your tickets to the Big Top here!
...this side of the Mississippi.
Hey! Get your kids outta here! Police!
Get 'em out of here! Go!
You, sir!
Step on up!
I see you eyeing the maze!
Don't be surprised! Don't be scared!
Step on up, sir!
Do you dare enter the cave of horrors?
You never know what you might find around the corner.
Don't show your fear in the presence of the tiger.
Or you may never escape this cave alive.
Alexei!
Oh, my God.
I... I just left for a minute...
for a corn dog.
A stupid corn dog.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Vasilev, are you there? Vasilev? Answer!
What are you doing?
Hey!
Larry. Joyce.
Ooh!
Yeah, lady!
Hey.
Comrade!
Get off me!
Goddamn!
Son of a bitch!
Hey!
Hit it. Hit it! Go! Go!
Alexei?
On the lower level
Hey, translate.
We've found the children.
They are still in the mall. Lower level.
Keep all entrances locked down.
I repeat
Keep all entrances locked down.
Everyone, get over here.
I found them.
What the hell?
You flung that thing like a Hot Wheel!
Lucas? What are you doing here?
Ask them. It's their fault.
True, yeah. Totally true. It's absolutely our fault.
I don't understand what happened to that car.
El has superpowers.
I'm sorry? Superpowers. She threw it with her mind.
C'mon, catch up. That's El?
Who's El? I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm Robin. I work with Steve. She cracked the top secret code.
Yeah, which is how we found out about the Russians.
Russians? Wait, what Russians?
The Russians! Those were Russians?
Some of them. What are you talking about?
Didn't you hear our code red? Yeah.
Couldn't understand what you were saying. Goddamn low battery.
How many times do I have to tell you with the low battery?
Well, everything worked out, didn't it?
Worked out? We almost died. Yeah, but we didn't, did we?
It was pretty damn close. Okay, Russians?
As in, they're working for the Russian government?
What are you not comprehending?
Am I not speaking English?
We have a fullblown Red Dawn situation.
So this has nothing to do with the gate?
It has everything to do with the gate...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
El! El!
What's wrong with her? What's wrong?
My leg. My leg.
Her leg, her leg. Okay.
Get that off. Okay.
El! El!
El! El, are you okay?
El! El!
El!
Still nothing? Nothing.
Food court? You sure they said food court?
I'm sorry, have my translation skills been letting you down?
We don't know it's your kids.
Yes, we do.
What is that? There's something in there.
No! Jesus Christ.
Keep her talking. Keep her awake, okay?
Jesus Christ.
Hey, hey, hey. Stay awake, stay awake. Let's get her on this side, on this side.
Easy, easy, easy, easy. It's, uh...
You know, it's not actually that bad. There was a...
The goalie on my soccer team, Beth Wildfire,
this other girl slid into her leg, and the bone came out of her knee,
six inches or something, it was insane. Robin.
Yeah? You're not helping.
I'm sorry.
Okay. All right, El?
This is gonna hurt like hell, okay?
Okay. Need you to stay real still.
Here, you're gonna want to bite down on this, okay?
Jesus Christ.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Do it.
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Jonathan! Stop talking!
Goddamn it! No! Stop it!
Stop! Stop!
I can do it.
I can do it.
God!
God!
The Mind Flayer, it built this monster in Hawkins,
to stop El, to kill her and pave a way into our world.
And it almost did. That was just one tiny piece of it.
How big is this thing?
It's big.
Thirty feet, at least. Yeah.
It sorta destroyed your cabin.
Sorry.
Okay, so, just to be clear, this...
this big fleshy spider thing that hurt El,
it's some kind of gigantic... weapon?
Yes. But instead of, like, screws and metal,
the Mind Flayer made its weapon...
with melted people.
Yes, exactly. Yeah, okay.
I Yeah, I'm just making sure.
Are we sure this thing is still out there, still alive?
El beat the shit out of it, but, yeah, it's still alive.
But if we close the gate again We cut the brain off from the body.
And kill it.
Theoretically.
Yoohoo!
Yoohoo!
"Okay, this is what Alexei called ""the hub."""
Now, the hub takes us to the vault room.
Okay, where's the gate?
Right here. I don't know the scale on this,
but I think it's fairly close to the vault room,
maybe 50 feet or so.
More like 500.
What, you're just gonna waltz in there like it's commie Disneyland or something?
I'm sorry, who are you?
Erica Sinclair. Who are you?
Murray...
Bauman.
Listen, Mr. Bunman,
I'm not trying to tell you how to do things,
but I've been down in that shithole for 24 hours.
And with all due respect, you do what this man tells you,
you're all gonna die.
I'm sorry, why is this fouryearold speaking to me?
Um, I'm ten, you bald bastard!
Erica! Just the facts!
She's right. You're all gonna die, but you don't have to. Excuse me.
Sorry, may I? Please.
Okay, see this room here? This is a storage facility.
There's a hatch in here that feeds into their underground ventilation system.
That will lead you to the base of the weapon.
It's a bit of a maze down there,
but between me and Erica, we can show you the way.
You can show us the way?
Don't worry, you can do all the fighting and the dangerous hero shit,
and we'll just be your...
navigators.
No.
Nope.
Well, that settles it.
He's gonna die. They're gonna die.
Yep, most likely.
You guys survived.
Barely.
We could've really used you guys down there.
Could've used you up here, too.
Yeah, man. We missed you, dude.
Yeah. Bigtime.
I missed you guys, too.
Bigtime.
Please don't cry, nerds.
Erica. Keep saying my name, see what happens.
Hey, heads up. You can navigate, just from someplace safe.
It's not that simple. The signal won't reach.
Not with this. You need something with a high enough frequency band
to relay with the Russians' radio tower.
But for that to work, you need someone who has both seen their comms room
and has access to a superpowered handcrafted radio tower,
one preferably already situated at the highest point in Hawkins.
Oh, wait.
That's me.
If you want us to navigate, you got us.
But we need a head start.
And a car.
Oh, man, now this...
this is what I'm talkin' about!
"""Toddfather""? Oh, screw Todd!"
Steve's her daddy now.
Did you just talk about yourself in the third person?
Did he just call himself daddy? All right, where are we going?
Weathertop. Weatherwhat?
Just drive. Okay. Jesus!
Bottom lock,
secondtotop lock,
thirdtotop lock,
top lock.
Listen to me, I need to end this,
but I will be back before you know it, okay?
I don't know, Mom. No, listen. You're gonna be safe there.
It's It's far away from all this.
You just stick close to your brother and and do whatever he says.
No matter what. Okay?
I'm not worried about me, Mom, I'm worried about you.
Oh, honey, I'm gonna be fine.
Okay? I'm gonna be fine.
Okay, Mom.
Okay, Mom. That's enough.
I'm gonna be fine. Okay.
Mom, I can't breathe.
My battery's low, but... You're suffocating me.
...it will recharge.
I know it will, kid.
I know.
I can fight.
Better than any of us.
But right now,
I need you safe.
This thing is after you.
It's not after me.
Do you understand?
Hey...
I need you to understand.
Okay?
Hey.
We should probably go.
Mike?
Be careful.
What?
It's a twoman operation. Two!
Yeah, well, change of plans. Change of plans?
Yeah. Will you explain it to him, please? We have two options here, Jim.
We can turn the machine off, or we can explode it.
Oh, yeah, says who? Says the man who built it!
Yeah, and we wanna explode it! Or else our heroic efforts
will be for naught!
This is a threeman operation, Jim, not two.
Yeah, three.
El, you're bleeding.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Here. Okay.
Here.
Lay down.
What's wrong? I don't...
I don't know.
You can't be serious. Come on!
Didn't your mom just buy this car?
Yes. I'm sure it's fine.
Did you leave the lights on? No.
Do we have gas? Yes!
Come on! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Just stop, stop!
Pop the hood.
What the hell? What?
The ignition cable's gone.
Back in the mall!
Back in the mall!
Go! Go, go, go! Be careful!
Go! Go!
Go, go, go!
So then I yank those cables like I'm pulling weeds.
And that'll set off the alarm According to Alexei,
may his soul rest in peace.
Which should give you two an opening to retrieve the keys from the vault.
And then we just follow the map to the observation room, turn the key
Kaboom, we blow this sucker skyhigh. Yeah.
And then, once the rift is closed, we escape back through the vents.
Right under their commie noses.
Then home free.
Uh...
Oh, God, just because it wasn't your plan doesn't mean it was a bad plan.
I didn't say it was a bad plan.
You made a noise.
I did not make a noise. You did too.
I really think it's disrespectful... What is up with you and noises?
Children! Children!
It is a good plan.
A solid B, which is laudable, given the situation and time constraints.
Dare I say, if it all goes right...
...they'll never even know we were here.
Stop right there!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Documents, important documents
for the LieutenantComrade!
He called us, last minute.
Pardon our sloppy appearance.
Lieutenant? What Lieutenant?
Lieutenant...
Molotov?
Oh, shit.
Jim...
This is crazy.
Oh, my God. Jim, I... This...
I had it under control.
Yeah, sure you did.
What are you doing?
I'm improvising.

I mean, nobody's scientifically perfect,

Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Scoops Troop, I repeat, do you copy?
We're trapped in the mall and in need of emergency transportation.
Scoops Troop, do you copy? Billy has found us.
He has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
Repeat: Billy has disabled our car and we are trapped in the mall.
Scoops Troop... You're gonna kill him, aren't you?
This is just a precaution, okay?
And not just against Billy.
If he knows we're here, so does the Mind Flayer.
Scoops Troop, I repeat, we are in need of emergency transportation.
Do you copy?
Scoops Troop, do you copy?
No chance that thing'll drive, right?
Steve, do you copy? We don't need it to drive.
Dustin!
We just need the ignition cable.
Push!
Shit!
Let me try.
El...
I can do it.
Can I help?
Picking up.
Do I know you?
New arrivals.
Landed last night.
Say goodbye to sunlight.
Who needs sunlight
when we have one another, comrade?
Indeed, comrade!
And a bottle of Stolichnaya.
Why are you talking so much?
He was nice.
He was nice? He was a nice guard.
Yeah, I mean, we should probably invite him over after all this is done.
Yeah, I can bake him a casserole.
Get a sixpack, share some laughs.
You know, have a drink.
Ugh.
Anyone wanna trade jobs?
Bald Eagle, do you copy?
Bald Eagle, I repeat, this is Scoops Troop, do you copy?
Yes, I copy.
Call sign?
Bald Eagle.
Please repeat.
Bald Eagle. This is Bald Eagle! Copy that.
Good to hear your voice, Bald Eagle. What's your 20?
We reached the vent. I'll contact you when I need you.
Until then, silence.
Roger that, Bald Eagle.
This is Scoops Troop, going radio silent. 1010, over.
I hate children.
Remember, if anyone says anything, just Smile and nod.
Good luck.
Push!
All right, great.
All right, now, all the way. Ready?
Three, two, one... Push!
Told you.
Physics.
How do we get it open?
Uh, there should be a latch. Check under the wheel.
You see it? I don't know, hold on.
What's she doing?
El.
Are you okay?
Do you see it? I don't know.
It should be right here.
Distributor, distributor...
Mike.
Got it.
Nancy!
Come on!
We just found them like this.
The American.
It's taking too long.
It's fine. No, it's not. It is not.
She could've died back there.
She almost did.
Well, she's safe now. She's on her way to Murray's.
That thing won't find her,
not before we kill it.
Hey. This isn't the way this is supposed to work, all right?
"You're supposed to say, ""Yes, I told you so."
"That's why we needed to go back to the kids."""
Oh, yeah, and then you say something like...
"""Yeah, well, it's really hard to listen"
"when you make everything sound like it's the end of the goddamn world."""
You know...
I think, despite everything, I mean, despite the arguing,
I think we make a pretty good team.
Well, we made it this far, didn't we?
Yeah.
We did.
We did.
So, uh...
did I get the job or what?
Ah, come on.
Detective Byers.
It has a ring, doesn't it?
It's kinda hard to serve in a town where you don't live, Detective.
You're still moving outta here. I mean, that is the plan, right?
Eh, we'll see how it goes.
"""How it goes""? How what goes?"
You know, if if we actually do make it out of here,
we we deserve to celebrate, right?
Yeah.
I mean...
yes.
Absolutely.
I hear Enzo's is pretty good.
What do you say, Friday, eight o'clock?
Uh, El likes to watch Miami Vice on Fridays.
It It starts at 10:00, so I I can't be out late on a Friday.
Okay, well, how about 7:00, then?
Enzo's, Friday, I meet you there?
No, you pick me up.
Picking you up, 7:00 p.m. Friday.
Yeah, it's a date.
Just for clarification, just because I... I mean, just... If...
"When you say ""date,"" just so that we're crystal clear,"
so there's no confusion Yeah? Yeah, Hop?
Stop talking or I'm gonna change my mind.
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
Okay.
Scoops Troop, this is...
Hm.
Bald Eagle.
I've reached another junction.
This is what? The fourth junction.
All right, so if memory serves, this is right after the My Little Pony thesis.
We went left, so he has to go right. Right.
Fly right, Bald Eagle.
Fly right. Roger that, flying right.
Little shit.
What's the My Little Pony thesis?
Don't get him started.
Get him started? Just tell me Hey, guys?

I told you, radio silence!
Yeah, but we have a problem.
What kind of problem?
It's turned away. If we go up the stairs now, we'll make it.
No way, not with El's leg. We have to try.
There's another way...
to get out.
Through the Gap.
Okay.
Now.
Bald Eagle has landed.

ohohfour.
Murray?
Your goddamn code...
is wrong.
What? Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Well, I I suppose it could be wrong.
How could it be wrong?
The code is a number, a famous number.
Planck's constant I I thought I knew it.
Planck's constant.
You know it? Not by heart. You?
I'm not a nerd, nerd.
He told me it was Planck's constant, which I know.
Why would I need him to give me a number I already know?
What are you doing?
Go, go, go!
Shit. Get the car started. Go!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.
Come on. We gotta go!
Come on!
We gotta go!
Are you okay?
Ask me tomorrow?
Oh, shit!
Get in!

Where have you been?
I'm so, so sorry. I I've been really busy...
uh, trying to save the world from Russians and monsters.
Of course you have.
Get the goddamn number already!
Who was that?
It was...
Uh, I don't know, actually. I think it was just some interference.
So, why don't we, uh, change frequency
to 14.158?

Dustybun, you copy? I copy, Suziepoo.
It sounds much better now, thanks.
Suzie. Okay, so, listen,
do you know Planck's constant?
Do you know the Earth orbits the sun?
Okay, so I know it starts with two sixes, and then a...
WWhat is it?
Okay, let me just be clear on this. I haven't heard from you in a week,
and now you want a mathematical equation that you should know
so you can... save the world?
Suziepoo, I promise,
I will make it up to you as soon as possible.
You can make it up to me now.
What? I want to hear it.
Not right now. Yes, now, Dustybun.
Suziepoo, this is urgent.
Yes, yes, you're saving the world, I heard you the first time,
but Ged is also saving Earthsea and he's about to confront the shadow,
so this is Suzie, signing off.
Wait, wait, wait! Okay.
Okay. Okay.

You told her...

You ran to her, on the beach.
There were seagulls.

Welcome to Hawkins, Indiana,
a wonderful place to grow up,
to raise your family,
to walk your dog.
But then...
...on July Fourth, everything changed.
A terrible tragedy struck this small town.
But this was not this small town's first brush with tragedy.
Mysterious deaths, government coverups,
a bizarre chemical leak.
Is it all linked?
All a vast conspiracy?
The fault of a disgraced, corrupt mayor?
Or is something more going on in the heartland?
Can a town itself be cursed?
Some believe a rise in Satanism is to blame.

Yeah. Why not? She's, like, super wellrespected.

Favorite movies? Did I stutter?

Which Star Wars?
The one with the teddy bears. Duh.
No? Uh... Oh, the one that just came out. The movie that just came out.
The one with the DeLorean and Alex P. Keaton,
and he's trying to bang his mom.

Yeah, those are my top three. Classics.
You start Monday.
You start never.
Will you just, um... Will you give us a minute?
Why?
Steve.
All right, you have to understand, Keith,
I know his taste is a bit pedestrian,
but the dingus has other qualities.
He's a douchebag of the highest order, Robin.
He was a bit of a prick to us in high school, I'll grant you that,
but he remains...
a total chick magnet.
Yeah, okay, and this is relevant to me how?
Uh, Earth to Keith.
The ladies will come in just to see him.
They'll come in in droves.
Droves, Keith.
We sold so much ice cream,
they had to get a second shipment in from Michigan.
Goddamn Michigan, Keith.
And these ladies...
These ladies are hot.
They're so very hot.
And there are too many of them for little Steve.
He needs assistance.
He needs your assistance, Keith.
What's in it for you? You got a thing for him or something?
Goddammit. This is
Hm.
We're just, um...
We're just friends.

And then I was thinking maybe you could come up here for Christmas.

Cool.
Mike?
Yeah?
Remember that day...
at the cabin, you were talking to Max?
Um...
I don't think I follow.
You talked about your your feelings,
your heart.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that. Man, that was so long ago. Um...
That was really heat of the moment stuff, and we were arguing and...
I don't really remember...
What did I say, exactly?
Mike...
I love you, too.
Donation box?
Uh, yeah, sure.
What is that?
Uh...
It It's the speech Hop wrote for you and Mike.
Speech?
Yeah. You know, the hearttoheart.
He never talked to you, did he?
Can I read?
"""There's something I've been wanting to talk to you both about."
I know this is a difficult conversation,
but I care about you both very much.
And I know that you care about each other very much.
And that's why it's important that we set these boundaries moving forward,
so we can build an environment...
where we all feel...
comfortable...
trusted...
and open...
"to sharing our feelings."""
Feelings.
Feelings.
Jesus.
The truth is,
for so long, I'd forgotten what those even were.
I've been stuck in one place,
in a cave, you might say.
A deep, dark cave.
And then, I left some Eggos out in the woods,
and you came into my life and...
for the first time in a long time,
I started to feel things again.
I started to feel happy.
But, lately, I guess I've been feeling...
distant from you.
Like you're...
you're pulling away from me or something.
I miss playing board games every night,
making tripledecker Eggo extravaganzas at sunrise,
watching westerns together before we doze off.
But I know you're getting older.
Growing.
Changing.
And I guess...
if I'm being really honest,
that's what scares me.
I don't want things to change.
So, I think maybe that's why I came in here,
to try to maybe... stop that change.
To turn back the clock.
To make things go back to how they were.
But I know that's naive.
It's just...
not how life works.
It's moving.
Always moving, whether you like it or not.
And, yeah, sometimes it's painful.
Sometimes it's sad.
And sometimes...
it's surprising.
Happy.
So, you know what?
Keep on growing up, kid.
Don't let me stop you.
Make mistakes, learn from 'em,
and when life hurts you, because it will,
remember the hurt.
The hurt is good.
It means you're out of that cave.
But, please,
if you don't mind,
for the sake of your poor old dad,
keep the door open three inches.

Six is trying to move a block.
A red block.
Can you hear what they're saying?
Something's wrong.
If you've lost the visual, just let it go.
Try to reorient.
They're screaming.

Dear Mike,
Today is day 185.
Feels more like ten years.
Joyce says time is funny like that.
Emotions can make it speed up or slow down.
We are all time travelers if you think about it.
For example, this week is going very fast.
I think because I am so busy.
I have to make something called a visual aid.
I hope Mrs. Gracey will give me an A.
I can send you a previous edition as a loaner
to see if you like the product before committing to purchasing it…
Some exciting news.
Joyce got an amazing new job.
She gets to work at home.
Yeah, I'm… I'm not a robot. You do realize that, don't you?
"She says she loves the ""freedom."""
Prick.
Will is painting a lot,
but he… he won't show me what he's working on.
Maybe it is for a girl.
I think there is someone he likes,
because he has been acting
weird.
Jonathan is acting weird also.
I think he is just nervous about college.
He is still waiting for his big letter.
I hope he and Nancy get to go together.
Damn it.
But I don't know how he'll get to college because his car is still broken.
His funny friend Argyle has been taking us to school.
His hair is longer than mine.
And he and Jonathan like to smoke smelly plants together.
Jonathan says the plants are super safe because they come from the earth,
but to not tell Joyce.
Me?
I am twice as happy now.
You were right. It just takes time.
All right.
Hold on to your butts, brochachos.
I think I have finally adapted.

Michael, I know your D & D club is tonight. Hellfire.
Why don't you call it the High School Dropout Club?
I want you home no later than 9:00. I'll try.
No trying. You need to go to bed early. Why?
It's a 6:30 flight, Michael. Yeah, I know, but
No buts. Nine or no California.

Yeah, I see it.
Yikes, Dusty.
Yeah.
I will repent later.
Then there's Heidi tomorrow night, but the problem with Heidi
is that she's going out of state for college.
Do I wanna start another relationship that has no point other than sex?
I mean, I don't know. Does that make sense to you?

What did I just say? Something about sex with Linda.
No, I'm talking about Heidi.
Cut me some slack, please. Well
Your love life is one of labyrinthine complexity.
It is 7:00 in the morning, we have the stupid pep rally,
and I woke up looking like a corpse.
You're worried about a pep rally? Expect me to believe that?
Yeah? So? So we both know what this is about.
Not buying that. This is about Vickie. Absolutely not.
It is. You know what else? I don't care
You gotta stop pretending to be someone else when you're around her.
You just gotta be yourself.
You're literally quoting me to me. You do realize that.
Maybe you need to listen to yourself. Ever think about that?
I listened. Look at me. Boom. Back in business.
It's not the same thing. Okay? Well…
You ask out a girl and she says no.
Big deal. Nothing happens. Maybe your ego's a little bruised.
I ask out the wrong girl, and bam, I'm a town pariah.
I'd buy that, except Vickie is definitely not the wrong girl.
We just don't know that, do we?
She returned Fast Times paused at 53 minutes, 5 seconds.
Know who pauses Fast Times at 53 minutes, 5 seconds?
People who like boobies, Robin. Ew!
Gross. Don't say boobies. Boobies.
Not a big deal, okay? I like boobies. You like boobies.
Vickie likes boobies. Definitely.

Look, I'm not saying that my girlfriend is better than yours.
It's just that Suzie's, like, a certified genius.
You do realize El saved the world twice, right?
And yet you still have a C in Spanish.
And let's hear it for your Tigers!
Whoo!
Good morning, Hawkins High!
First off… Hey.
First off, I'd like to thank each and every one of you.
Without your support, we wouldn't be here.
Give yourselves a big hand.
And of course, of course, I have to give a special shoutout
to the best and the prettiest fans of all time,
the Tiger Cheer Squad.
Yeah!
Chrissy…
Chrissy, I love you, babe.
Aww!
You know…
I think I can speak for all of us when I say
it's been a tough year for Hawkins.
So much loss.
"And sometimes I wonder, ""How much loss can one community take?"""
In dark days like this, we need something to believe in.
So, last night,
when we were down by ten points at half to Christian Academy,
I looked at my team,
and I said,
"""Think of Jack."""
"""Think of Melissa."""
"""Think of Heather."""
"""Think of Billy."""
"""Think about our heroic police chief, Jim Hopper."""
"""Think about every one of our friends who perished in that fire."""
"""What did they die for?"""
"""For us to lose to some… some crap school?"""
"""No."" No!"
"""For us to return home with our heads hung low in defeat?"""
"""No!"" No!"
"""No."""
"""Let's win this game."""
"""Let's win this game for them."" And that's exactly what we did!"
We embarrassed those candyasses in their own house,
and now tonight, tonight,
we're gonna bring home the championship trophy!
Let's go!
Tonight?
How is that possible? They call it a tournament.
You win one game, you go on until there's only one team left.
I don't get the big deal. Just talk to Eddie.
Get him to move Hellfire to another night.
"""Just talk to Eddie."""
Why don't you just talk to your coach and get him to move the game?
I think that's a great idea, Mike. Thank you, Dustin.
This is the championship game. And this is the end of Eddie's campaign.
A semester of adventuring has led to this moment, and we need you.
Yeah, and the Tigers don't. You've been on the bench all year.
That's not the point. Please, arrive at the point.
If I get in good with these guys,
I'll be in the popular crowd, and then you guys will be too.
Has it ever occurred to you that we don't want to be popular?
You wanna be stuck with the nerds and freaks for three more years?
We are nerds and freaks.
But maybe we don't have to be.
Look, I'm tired of being bullied.
I'm tired of girls laughing at us.
I'm tired of feeling like a loser.
We came to high school wanting things to be different. Right?
So now we have that chance.
I skip tonight, that's all out the window.
So I'm asking you guys,
as a friend,
just talk to Eddie.
Get him to move Hellfire.
Come to my game.
Please.
Shit.
Mrs. Ergenbright, let me ask you something.
Mmhmm. Have you ever wished
you could have the answer to any question, right at your fingertips?
Oh, gosh.
Yes. It's just like those… those big fancy books you see on TV.
Oh, yes, they're lovely.
Yeah, just imagine, you'd never have to go to the library again.
Or, hey, think of the money that you'll save on gas alone.
Oh, good point. Anything?
Nothing.
Acceptance letters tend to come end of week to make you sweat.
Well, I'm sweating.
It's coming, Mrs. Byers. Don't you worry. I always worry. Thanks.
Oh, gosh. Did I lose you? Hello?
No, sorry. Carol? Can I call you Carol?
Of… Of course. Great. So, what are we thinking?
Could do volumes A through C, or we could do the… the whole alphabet.
Well, uh, remind me how much money…
I can't remember
Carol, uh, can I call you back?
Oh, sure.
After learning to speak,
she traveled the world to spread her message,
and along the way,
changed how the world perceived those like her with disabilities.
And that is why I have chosen
Helen Keller as my hero.
That was wonderful, Angela.
Truly wonderful.
What an inspiring story.
Okay. Now let's see who has to follow that.
Jane.
Hi.
For my hero,
I…
I chose my dad.
And for my visual aid,
"I made a ""direyama"" of our cabin."
More like diarrhea.
Quiet, everyone.
Let's be respectful.
This is my dad.
His name is Hopper.
He made the best Eggos,
and… …we liked to watch Miami Vice on Fridays.
This is Mr. Fibbly.
He is a squirrel.
What?
And this is the alarm that my dad made.
I… I was never scared because…
beca because…
Uh, Angela, let's save questions until the end of Jane's presentation.
Yeah. Sorry.
I'm just, like, confused.
I thought this was a presentation about a historical hero.
My dad was in the newspaper.
Your local paper?
I just don't think that's what Mrs. Gracey meant by historical.
This is supposed to be about famous people.
My dad is famous.
He… He saved lots of lives.
In a mall fire.
He was a hero for people.
And he was my hero too.
That's not what I'm saying at all, but it's okay.
I am so sorry, Mrs. Gracey.
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I just wanted clarity on the rules of the assignment.
Well, technically, you are correct,
but Jane has decided to do her father.
So,
please, continue with your presentation, Jane.
El, it wasn't that bad.
Friends don't lie.
I'm not lying.
El.
Come on.

A ghost?
Really?
Max,
I know something's wrong.
Yeah, right.
Something must be wrong with me because I broke up with you.
No.
No, that… that's not what I meant.
Lucas, look,
people just change, okay?
That's it.
I've changed.
It's that simple.
Good luck.
Hey, are you all right?
Yeah Yes, I'm…
I'm fine.
Okay, um…
You're sure?
Please, just go away.
Are you deaf? I said go away.
Chrissy?
Chrissy?
Mom?
You ready to try on the dress again?
I loosened the back a little for you.
Chrissy! Did you hear me?
Open the goddamn door, Chrissy…
…or I'm gonna gut you like the fat pig that you are.
Go away! Go away! Go away!
Did you hear me? Go away!
Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away!
Can you hear me?

He's always revved up.
We'll just act casual.
Casual. Casual.
Right, okay.
Totally.
Society has to blame something.
We're an easy target. Exactly.
We're the freaks because we like to play a fantasy game.
But as long as you're into band

…or parties
or a game where you toss balls into laundry baskets…
Loser! You want something, freak?
Prick.
It's forced conforming.
That's what's… …killing the kids!
That's the real monster.
So, uh, speaking of monsters,
uh,
Lucas has to do his, uh,

So…
…he's not gonna be able to make it to Hellfire tonight.
And I know there's no way we can beat your sadistic campaign without him.
So, me and Mike,
we were talking,
shooting the shit,
and we were thinking that maybe we might…
Postpone.
Postpone? Can't just drop this on us! Over my dead body.
Shut up!
You saying Sinclair's been taken in by the dark side?
Uh, something like that. Something like that?
Jesus Christ.
And rather than find a sub for him,
you want… you want to postpone
"""The Cult of Vecna""?"
I…I don't want to postpone it. We don't want to postpone it.
It's just that, you know, most of the subs will be at the championship game.
Oh, it's the championship game? Yeah.
Can I level with you?
Jeff graduates this year.
Gareth's got, what? A year and a half?
Me, I am armycrawling my way toward a D in Ms. O'Donnell's.
If I don't blow her final,
I'm gonna walk that stage next month,
I'm gonna look Principal Higgins dead in the eye,
I'm gonna flip him the bird,
I'm gonna snatch that diploma.
I'm gonna run like hell outta here.
Didn't you say that last year? And the year before?
Yeah, yeah, and I was full of shit.
This year's different.
This year is my year.
I can feel it.
'86, baby.
You know what that means?
It means you boys
are the future of Hellfire.
I knew it the moment I saw you.
You sat on that table right over there, looking like…
looking like two little lost sheep.
You were wearing a Weird Al Tshirt,
which I thought was brave.
Thank you.
Mike, you were wearing whatever shit your mommy bought you from goddamn Gap.
And we showed you
that school didn't have to be the worst years of your lives, right?
No. Okay, no, no.
Well, I'm here to tell you
that there are other little lost sheepies out there who need help.
Who need you.
And all you guys gotta do
is get your BoPeeps on and go and find one.
Where the hell have you been?
I have karate from 1:00 to 3:00 on Fridays.
So let me see if I have this right.
You received a doll in the mail.
Yes. And it's creepy.
Oh, yes.
And you believe it's from Russia, huh?
I know it is. Hmm.
The… The stamps on the package have that hammer with that hook thingamajig.
Sickle. Whatever.
Sounds like it came from Russia.
Wow, I am so glad I called you.
Should I be worried?
I would be.
Ah!
Could be a threat.
After all, you did sabotage their U.S. operation
and killed about two dozen comrades.
But how would they know my name?
If it's the KGB, Joyce,
and they wanna find out who you are, they will.
Wait, can you undress her?
What? The creepy doll.
Can you remove her dress?
I don't…
Okay.
Jesus.
What?
She has nipples.
Yeah!
Okay, now, do you see anything taped to her?
Wires or a bug or something?
I don't know. It's… It's cracked.
Cracked?
Yeah, like, the porcelain's cracked and they tried to glue it back together.
Okay, okay. Uh, do you have rope
and something heavy?
What for?
Smashing.
What do you think, Byers?
I call it a weeder.
You get it, man? Like a feeder?
Weeder?
Clever.
Hey, where are you going, man?
Look, I'm just trying to turn that frown upside down, man.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, come on, man.
What, are you gonna be moping around all break or what?
I'm not moping. You're moping.
Really? Mopey Dick.
Wow, wow, that's clever.
Is this because your girl is ditching you?
What? Nancy's not ditching me.
Oh, so she's coming now?
No.
Ah, so she's ditching you.
Dude, no, she's not ditching me.
She has to work.
Who the hell works over spring break?
Nancy. Nancy does.
Maybe I'm missing something, but why can't Jonathan come down here for break?
Because. Because why?
Because a lot of reasons.
Curious.
Um, do you mind if I take a crack at this, Candace?
Um, go ahead. All yours.
You said there's lots of reasons he's not coming. Such as?
Why are you being so nosy? Call it journalistic instinct.
Okay, well, there's no story here, if that's what you're after.
His mom works,
so he has to watch over his brother.
On top of that, he's not early decision like me,
so he's waiting on his acceptance letter, and he wants to be there when it comes.
Which I totally get.
Okay.
Um, I don't. It just…
…doesn't make any sense, dude.
Okay, let me sift through this mess.
Nancy is the supposed love of your life.
In fact, you're so smitten that you have this grand plan
to go to some fancyschmancy college, AKA money pit, together?
And yet he's so nervous about this acceptance letter,
he doesn't have time to visit the most desired girl in Hawkins?
That doesn't pass the smell test.
In fact, it stinks to high heaven.
Whoo!
Look, you're a good boy, okay?
You've been a good boy, man.
And I think it's way past due you give that right hand of yours a vacation
and get you some welldeserved hankypanky.
Okay, first of all, Fred, I'm going to try to forget that you said any of that.
It's… Gross, dude.
It's natural. You don't understand Nancy.
He's not like you. He's caring and compassionate and…
…incredibly ambitious. She's never done a single thing halfway in her life.
He's so protective over the people that he loves.
If she takes on the editor of the school paper,
she's gonna make that the best paper that ever existed.
And he'll never back down from what's right, what's moral.
No matter the pressure, no matter the personal cost…
That's why I love her. That's why I love him.
Everything between us is… Perfect.
Eh, I'm still rooting for my alt.
Nancy!
Nancy, hey.
Um, do you wanna join Hellfire tonight?
Just move your date this one time.
Come on.
"What, to hang out with you and Eddie ""the freak"" Munson?"
Uh, yeah, I'll pass.
You're just jealous 'cause I have another older male friend.
Ew. Ugh. Whatever.
Besides, I mean, I really dig this girl.
I think that she could…
Who knows, she could be the one.
Oh, I got some customers. Call you back. Bye.
No, you can't. I'm at…
…school.
So you fight with dice?
Yes, but these aren't your normal dice.
They have up to 20 sides.
If I play, do I get one of those cool Tshirts?
Yes. Really?
Everyone gets a Tshirt. We make 'em ourselves, and if you…
You're being sarcastic.
You being sarcastic?
♪ Do you wanna… ♪
She was being sarcastic.
Mom says the game promotes Satanism and animal cruelty.
That's just bullshit media propaganda.
60 Minutes begs to differ.
No. No.
No.
No. No.
I hate high school.
So, screw it.
Screw what?
Screw high school.
What? What? Dustin, where are you going?
Just trust me!
Come on, just talk to me.
Tell me things!
Wear a helmet! What are you talking about?
Hello?
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you.
You okay?
There's, uh… There's nothing to worry about. Okay?
No one ever comes out here.
We're safe.
I promise.
So, how does this work exactly?
Oh, just like any other old sale,
except, uh, cash only,
and, uh, for obvious reasons,
no receipts.
I'll do you a half ounce for, uh… 20. What do you say?
Plenty of bang for your buck. Should last a while.
Hey, uh, we don't need to do this.
Just give me the word and I'll walk away.
Okay? It's not that. I don't want you to go.
It's just…
Do you ever feel like
you're losing your mind?
Um,
you know, just… on a daily basis.
I feel like I'm losing my mind right now
doing a drug deal with Chrissy Cunningham,
the queen of Hawkins High.
You know, this isn't the first time that we've, um…
hung out.
No?
You don't remember?
I'm sorry. I
That's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either, Chrissy.
Honestly, do I have stuff in my hair?
You don't remember me?
I'm sorry.
Middle school, talent show.
You were doing this cheer thing.
You know, the… the thing you do.
It was pretty cool, actually.
And I…
I was with my band. Corroded Coffin.
Corro You do remember. Oh my God! Yes, of course.
With a name like that, how could I forget?
I dunno. You're a freak.
No, you just…
You looked so Different?
Yeah. Well, uh, my hair was buzzed,
and I didn't have these sweet old tatties yet.
You played guitar, right? Uhhuh.
Still do. Still do.
You should come see us.
Uh, we play at The Hideout on Tuesdays.
It's pretty cool. We… We actually get a crowd
of about five drunks.
It's not exactly the Garden, but you gotta start somewhere, right? So…
You know, you're not what I thought you'd be like.
Mean and scary? Yeah.
Yeah, well, I actually kinda thought you'd be kinda mean and scary too.
Me?
Terrifying.
Uh, so,
in other good news, flattery works with me, so…
Twentyfive percent discount for the half.
Fifteen bucks. You're robbing me blind here, you know.
Do you have anything
maybe
stronger?
Nice job, Kate.
Excellent work, Paul. Nice improvement.
Very disappointing, Jane.
Let's talk after break.
Oh! Oh my God.
I am so sorry.
I hope Mr. Fibbly's okay.
Whoops!
Oh my God.
Angela!
Holy shit!
What the hell was that?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, what's going on here?
What's going on? Jane?
Jane.
Did someone do this?
I tripped.
It was just an accident.
All right, Angela. You come with me.
Ooh! What? Why?
Let's go.
I didn't do anything. Tell her, Jane. Tell her!
Shit. El. El.
Shit.
El…
I'm sorry.
It's gonna be okay.
It… It's not that bad.
We'll fix it together, okay?
Okay? Shit.
Come on, kids.
Don't stare.
Oh, hi.
Mommy, what's she doing?
Was this really necessary?
If that porcelain belly is pregnant with an explosive device,
you will soon be thanking me.
And remember, you are not lowering this bucket. You are…
Releasing it. Got it.
We want to make sure that we destroy that doll
with as much force as possible.
Yep. Got it.
One more thing.
Joyce. Are you there? Talk to me! Joyce! Joyce!
Joyce! Joyce! Joyce!
Joyce! Yeah?
What happened?
It broke.
Do you see a bug?
Anything with wires?
Or anything that… that doesn't look like the insides of a doll.
Anything like that?
Joyce! Joyce!
Where'd you go? Where'd you go now?
Why are you not answering me again?
Joyce!

Let's go, Tigers!
Let's go, Tigers!
Does it bother you that, like,
we might win a championship right after you graduated?
Yeah, that's an interesting point.
Thank you so much for bringing that up, Brenda.

This is Hellfire Club. Not Babysitting Club.
I'm 11, you longhaired freak.
My, my, the child speaks.
So, what's your name, child?
Erica Sinclair.
So this is Sinclair's infamous sister.
He's sharp.
What's your class and level? Level one dwarf?
My name is Lady Applejack.
And I'm a chaotic good halfelf rogue, level 14.
I will sneak behind any monster you throw my way
and stab them in the back with my poisonsoaked kukri.
And I'll smile as I watch them die a slow, agonizing death.
So, we gonna do this,
or we gonna keep chitchatting like this is your mommy's book club?
Welcome to Hellfire.
Push 'em back, defense! Push 'em back…
Hey! Yo, you gotta stay on 'em.
Stay on 'em! Let's go! Go!
Looks like my headline has a shot.

"""Hail Lord Vecna."""
"""Hail Lord Vecna."""
They turn to you,
remove their hoods.
You recognize most of them from Makbar.
But there is one you do not recognize,
his skin shriveled,
desiccated.
And something else.
He is not only missing his left arm,
but his left eye!
No! No!
Vecna's dead. He was killed by Kas.
So it was thought, my friends. So it was thought.
But Vecna lives.
Yo, what the hell was that?
What the hell was that? That's not me, that's him.
You are scared. You're tired. You are injured.
Do you flee Vecna and his cultists?
Or stand your ground and fight?
Come on.
Sinclair, you're in. Huh?
You're in. Son, let's go!
I say we fight.
To the death.
To the death.
To the death.
To the death! To the death!
To the death! To the death!

Guys, I hate to say this, but we've got to flee.
"I concur. Didn't we just agree ""to the death""?"
That wasn't literal.
Vecna just decimated us. We can't kill him with two players.
You too? He only has 15 hit points left. Don't be pussies.
Pussies? Really? 'Cause we're not delusional?
Delusional? How about not cowards? Hey!
If I may interject, gentlemen, Lady Applejack.
Whilst I respect the passion,
you'd be wise to take Gareth the Great's concern to heart.
There is no shame in running.
Don't try to be heroes.
Not today, 'kay?
One sec.
What do you think?
How many hit points do you and Applejack have left?
Twelve.
Here, on inbound,
they're gonna try and take away Jason and doubleteam him.
That is gonna free up Patrick.
Wait, no. You gotta let me take the shot.
It's risky as hell.
But you're the ones on the battlefield.
So it's your call.
What do you say, Lady Applejack? You really gotta ask?
Screw it.
Let's kill the son of a bitch.
Winners find a way to win. Let me find a way.

After a tragic year for our town,
the Tigers have brought home the conference title
for the first time in 22 years.
And what a great game it was, Allen,
ending with a dramatic buzzerbeater from benchwarmer Lucas Sinclair.
He must be feeling on top of the world right
All right, all right, I hear you.
It'll be 3.07. Yeah.
But this is your old friend Billy talking.
You know, just… just a little favor. And I don't think
No. I don't wanna do that stuff.
Not for you, not for anybody.
I'm trying to be normal, Billy.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
Here you go. Good boy.
This is, uh, my castle.
Okay. All right.
One more. That's it though, right?
Good boy.
Sorry for the mess.
Uh, the maid took the week off.
You, um…
You live here alone?
With my uncle.
But, uh, he works nights at the plant.
Bringing home the big bucks.
How long does it take?
Sorry?
The Special K. How long to kick in?
Oh, uh, well, it depends if you snort it or not.
Uh, if you do,
then, uh, yeah.
It'll, uh, kick in pretty quick.
Oh, shit.
You're sure you have it? No, no, I got it.
Um, somewhere.
Uh…
Sorry I'm late, sweetheart.
You're beautiful.
Eddie? Did you find it?
Eddie?
Eddie?
Eddie?

You're going to look… …absolutely beautiful.

Wake up, Chrissy.
Chrissy, wake up!

Mr. Munson.
Where is she?
I just found her there.
I swear, I don't even know her name. I never seen her 'fore.
Just calm down and stay back.
What you boys doing?
Holy mother of God.
Hey!
You can't be out here. Get back inside.
Back inside.
Hey, Frank. Chief Powell here.
Listen…
We caught a body over here at the Munsons' trailer.
I don't even know how to describe it.
I've never seen anything like it.
Uh, look…
…I need you down here ASAP
to tell me what the hell I'm looking at,
or how someone could even do something like this.
Flight 623 just landed from Indianapolis
and will be arriving at gate two.
Flight 623 from Indianapolis at gate two.
Mike.
Ah!
Oh, careful, careful, careful. You're squishing your present.
It's a gift.
I, uh I handpicked those for you in Hawkins.
I know you like yellow, but now I'm realizing it's too much yellow.
I know you also like purple, so I got purple as well.
So I kinda did, like, a 70/30 split kinda thing.
They're perfect. Thank you. Oh. Oh!
Hey. How you doing?
Hey, Mike. How you doing?
Yeah, good, man.
Great. Uh, what's that?
Um, it's nothing. Just this painting I've been working on.
Cool.
That's a rad shirt, man.
Ocean Pacific?
Oh, hey, Mike. This is, uh, my friend Argyle.
Oh. Hey.
Oh no, no, no.
No, it's a shitty knockoff. Yeah.
But don't sweat it. I'll get you the good threads out here.
I heard a lot about your sister.
Uh.
OOkay. Um, should we go?
Yeah, this is kinda awkward, man.
Yeah, so awkward.
I really thought it was Ocean Pacific.
I have our whole day planned.
First, El Rodeo for burritos.
What, really? Burritos for breakfast?
Yes. Trust me.
Yeah, no, I… I trust you. It's just, you know, a little weird.
Then, after burritos, I want to go to RinkOMania.
RinkOMania, okay. What's RinkOMania?
It's the most fun place in Lenora.
They have skating and games.
Sounds awesome. Are your friends gonna meet us?
Friends? What… What friends?
You know, Stacy and Angela.
Angela? You'll meet them, I promise.
Just not today. I want today to be about me and you.
Where to? 4819 Lonzo Way.
Let's go. This is life or death. Snap, snap!
Yes, sir.
Then Vicki laughed. And it wasn't like a cheap, fake laugh either.
It was like… It was a real, genuine laugh.
Of course. It's my Muppet joke. It's hilarious.
My point is that Vicki laughed and everything was just like…
It was perfect. But?
But I'm having this problem where it's like, I should stop talking.
I have said everything I need to say.
But then I guess I get nervous, and the words keep spilling out,
and it's like my… my brain is moving faster than my mouth,
or… or rather my… my mouth is moving faster than my brain.
I'm digging this hole for myself,
and I want to stop digging, I'm trying to stop, but I can't.
And I'm doing it right now, aren't I?
Yeah, you are.
Oh, I'm hopeless.
Eh.
We both are.
If only we could just, like, combine.
Combine?
No, think about it.
I know exactly what I want, and I've found the girl of my dreams,
but I can't get the courage to ask her out.
Mm. Meanwhile, you go on a million dates.
And you have no idea what you want. Mmhmm.
So if we just combined, all our problems would be solved.
Because, I mean, alone, let's face it…
We totally suck.
Totally and utterly.
Ooh, I think I found our morning movie.
Doctor Zhivago.
Ugh, you know I don't do double VHS.
But it's about doomed love.
Oh, well, that's relatable. Precisely.
Also, Julie Christie is bbbonkers hot in this.
Like, seriously, the most beautiful creature
I have seen in my life.
We're in the Forest Hills trailer park in east Roane County.
We don't have a lot of details now, but we can confirm
that the body of a Hawkins High student was discovered early this morning.
Police have not released the name… Holy shit.
…although we are told they're currently in the process of notifying the family.
You all right in there, Sinclair?
I'm good.
First hangover feels like you're gonna split in two,
but you'll live.
…occurred here is sure to touch a nerve across the community of Hawkins,
which is still reeling from last year's devastating mall fire.
Over 30 innocent…
…completely blocked off at…
Come on.
Just hit it, man.
Yo, just hit it. Yeah.
But whatever has occurred…
Piece of shit. There you go. See?
…is newly appointed police chief Calvin Powell,
who served as deputy under Chief Hopper.
What's this? I thought we were watching ThunderCats.
Hawkins student got murdered.
What?
Yeah, it's on every channel.
As you can see behind me, Chief Powell and the Hawkins Police Department
are actively investigating the scene…
They say who it is?
No, not yet.
Hey, maybe Chrissy didn't stand you up after all.
Hey, don't say that.
Relax, it was a joke.
A joke? Come on, someone just died and you're making a joke out of it?
It was at the trailer park,
so probably some druggy OD'd on heroin or some shit.
Oh, see, that makes it funnier.
What is up your ass this morning? It was a joke.
We also don't yet know if foul play was involved.
But whatever has occurred here
is sure to touch a nerve across Hawkins.
Ever since that girl, Barb, died a few years ago,
it has been one thing after another.
I'll tell ya, you start to believe all those things they say,
that this town is cursed,
that the devil lives here in Hawkins.
Nancy!
I don't think anyone's gonna care about the basketball game anymore.
Nancy?
Earth to Nancy. What?
I said I don't think anyone's gonna care about the game.
Yeah. No, I know.
Would you be up for a field trip?
Many of the residents we spoke to voiced similar concerns to us.
Grief, shock, disbelief, anger.
Everyone wants to know the same thing,
how can so many tragedies befall a oncepeaceful town?
All eyes are now on the police for answers.
Is the new chief of police, Powell, in over his head?
Or is he the very savior this town needs?
We'll be here the rest of the day right here on channel nine,
where we'll keep you posted on all the latest developments.
In the meantime, we recommend you keep your doors and windows locked tight.
This is Beverly Moss, signing off for…
My heart can't take it anymore. It just can't take it.
Chrissy Cunningham?
You're sure it was Chrissy?
Yes, in her cheerleader outfit. Same thing she was in when I saw her with Eddie.
Did you tell all this to the cops? No.
No, but I… I can't be the only one who saw them together.
They stood out.
Eddie the freak with Chrissy the cheerleader?
Exactly. You know, his name's not in the news yet or anything,
but I guarantee you Eddie is suspect one now.
That's crazy.
Eddie didn't do this. No way.
No way.
We can't rule it out. Yes, we can.
Dustin! You don't know him like I do, Max.
Okay?
When we got to high school, Lucas made all his sports friends.
Mike and me?
I mean, no one was nice to us.
No one except Eddie.
Okay. Well, they said the same shit about Ted Bundy.
Yeah, he's a super nice guy,
but then he's murdering women on the weekend.
So you're saying Eddie is like Ted Bundy?
No, I'm not saying I'm saying that we can't presume anything, okay?
But it doesn't look good for Eddie.
Why haven't you told the cops this?
I… I don't know.
You don't know?
After I saw Eddie and Chrissy go in the trailer…
…something else happened.
Okay, all right. Last one.
Come on.
Nothing that weird or anything. I mean…
Eddie always drives like a maniac,
and the power goes off at my place all the time. It's a piece of shit. But…
This morning, I started to think back, and…
I don't know.
The look on his face.
He was scared, Dustin.
Really scared.
Maybe he was scared because,
you know, he… he just killed someone, or…
maybe, um…
maybe be... because…
I don't… I don't know, maybe…
Something else killed her.
But that's impossible.
Right?
I don't know.
It should be.
Only one person knows what actually happened.
Eddie.
Have you talked to anyone else? No.
I can't find Lucas or Nancy, and Mike's in
California. Shit, shit, shit.
Where you going? To see a friend.
You heard the news. It's not safe. We'll be careful. Thanks. Love you. Bye.

I like it even less in person.
"What do you mean, ""Like it less""?"
I don't trust it.
For starters, who the hell sent this?
A friend?
A friend? Of Hop's?
"""Hop is alive. No government""?"
This looks and reads like a ransom note, and a bad one at that.
There's no proof of life here. Yes, there is.
"It's signed ""Enzo."""
So? So?
There's only two people who knew about our date at Enzo's,
and that's me and Hop.
So, whoever wrote this,
Hop trusted enough to make him sign it Enzo.
He's sending me a message.
You saw him die, Joyce.
I didn't see a body.
Because he evaporated.
Or…
he survived.
Okay. Okay.
Let's indulge this fantasy for a moment.
He's Houdini.
He's a cat man with nine lives.
Whatever it is, he survives.
What's he doing in Russia? He was captured, that's what.
Then he probably met some new friends.
And by friends, I mean the KGB.
And believe me when I tell you, these people are the worst of the worst.
I am talking torture, Joyce.
And no matter how strong you think Jim is,
they will break him.
They will get his whole life story.
And yes, that might very well include a planned date at Enzo's with you,
his coconspirator,
making this all an elaborate ruse to capture you as well.
You just made all that up.
It's a theory.
I prefer mine.
So do I.
Doesn't make it right.
Well, either way,
this could be real.
Hopper could be alive.
I suppose there's only one way to find out.
What are you doing?
We're gonna call that number
and you're going to find out
who the hell sent you that letter.
But we're doing it… my way.
Where do you think you're going?
Tell me, who you work with?
I told you,
no one.
This woman,
who is she?
Why don't you tell me?
She's wearing a Russian uniform.
Get the Elephant.
You want to die for this woman, American?
Hey, Will.
We'll be back at 6:00.
Have fun, okay?
Okay.

Will does not, but I go to parties here. No
It's a big party place.
Oh, I forgot. You need socks.
Oh, shit.
They… They sell them at the counter. Oh, okay.
How'd you forget about the socks?
I mean, since you come here all the time.
I… I don't know. I just forgot.
Right.
Why do you keep lying?
What? Why do you keep lying to Mike?
I'm not lying. You're not?
You're friends with Angela and Stacy and you come to parties here?
I have been to a party here. For Mom's work.
That's not what you implied.
I just… I don't think Mike's gonna like that you're lying to him.
And he doesn't deserve that. When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
Okay, so, I asked for vomit green and I got vomit green.
Isn't that awesome?
I'm so bad at this, I'm like Bambi on ice.
No, you're good. You got this.
Okay.

Hey.
I'm sure it's nothing, all right?
Probably the neighbors complained about the noise or some shit.
You all right?
Yeah.
I'm good.
All right.
And you were here all night?
Yes.
Ask anyone.
Oh, we will, but thank you for the suggestion.
I see a whole lot of beer around.
You have fun last night? What, you gonna arrest me for drinking?
It is against the law, so we could.
Should we?
I'd vote for trespassing, myself.
I don't think Benny's family would be too thrilled
to see what you've done to his place.
Yo, people been using this shithole for years, man.
Act like you guys didn't know.
What about your girlfriend?
She party here last night?
Chrissy?
No.
That's odd, what with her being your girlfriend and all.
Why you asking about Chris? When's the last time you talked to her?
After the game.
Look, this… this doesn't have to do with that dead student, does it?
What did Chrissy say when you talked to her?
Well, shshe…
I mean, said she was gonna go home, get changed, something like that.
Did she mention anything about buying drugs for the party?
Drugs? No. No way. Chrissy doesn't mess with that crap.
Maybe someone talked her into it. No. She's straight as an arrow.
What about Eddie Munson?
Ever seen her talking to him?
That freak?
No.
No way.
Wait, what…
What does Eddie have to do with all this?
Did that freak hurt her?
He hurt Chrissy?
Did he hurt Chrissy?
Jason. Hey, man, you all right?
Jason, what happened?
Where are you going? Is everything good?
What did they say?
Are they gonna call our parents?
Jason!
Hey, Steve.
You see this? How many phones do you have?
Someone was murdered. How many phones do you have?
Two. Why? Technically three, if you count Keith's.
Yeah, three works.
What are you doing?
What are you My pile!
No, no, no! My tapes! Dude.
What are you doing, man?
Setting up base of operations here. Base of operations?
Get off. I need it.
For what? Eddie's friends' phone numbers.
Your new best friend you think is cooler because he plays your nerdy game?
Yes. I never said that.
Seriously, you guys, maybe on a Monday you can play around, but it's Saturday.
It's our busiest day.
Robin, I empathize, but this cannot wait. Oh my God.
Calling Eddie's friends is an emergency?
Correct! Want me to strangle him or you want to?
We could take turns.
Can you fill them in while I do this? Fill us in on what?
What's our game plan?
Game plan?
Yeah.
When you and Jonathan investigated for Hawkins Post, did you split up or…?
Well, first of all, you're not Jonathan.
Clearly not.
I'm here, present and accounted for.
I've gone through a lot of managing editors. Okay?
Ooh, somebody's testy.
Curious.
I'm annoyed he's not here. Okay? Is that what you wanna hear?
And yeah, something's going on with him.
But that's not the mystery we're investigating today.
A student died.
The game plan is for you to let me do the talking, for you to take notes,
and for you to follow my lead at all times.
Is that understood?
Totally and completely.
Shit. Slow down, slow down.
Just act casual.
And follow your lead.
Got it.
Hi, officer. Can't get through. Got a crime scene.
Yeah, um, I... I was just going to…
um…
see Max Mayfield, a friend.
She lives in there.
We're restricting access to residents only.
It's just, um,
her mom is working today
and we would really like to check in on her.
We're basically her nanny. Nannies.
Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Yeah.
Actually, I do know you.
You're Fred Benson.
You killed that kid last year.
What?
That ugly scar on your face.
It's from that crash.
It… It was an accident.
An accident?
Is that why you ran all the way home instead of calling us?
You're a murderer is what you are.
Everyone here knows it.
A murderer. A murderer. A murderer.
Murderer. Murderer. Murderer.
Murderer. Murderer. Murderer!
You all right there? What?
I said, you all right, kid? You're looking a little peaked.
Fine.
I'm fine.
He's just, um, on edge.
I mean, we all are.
I'll let you check on your friend, but be fast. Yeah?
Of course, officer. Thank you.
Okay, what was that?
I said act casual.
Yeah, it's just…
Sorry.
Yes!
I don't know.
Part of me expected her to be on that plane.
Or something.
"Just like, ""Hey, surprise!"""
"""Here I am."""
But also… Shit!
…I felt this…
I felt this intense relief
when she wasn't there.
No, that's the Purple Palm Tree Delight working its magic, my man.
Makes your troubles float away
like the seed pods of a dandelion flowing in the wind.
No.
No, that's not it.
Hey…
If I show you something,
you wouldn't tell anyone, right?
Who would I tell? You're my only friend, Jonathan.
Yes.
What's that?
It's an acceptance letter to Lenora Community.
That's where I'm going. I know.
But you're going to Emerson with Nancy.
No, I'm not.
She just doesn't know it yet.
Hold on, what is going on?
Like, I… I can't leave my mom and my brother
to… to… to chase a dream that isn't mine.
You're dead, man. You are so dead.
What was I supposed to do?
Not lie. Not lie?
Yeah. Not lie?
Yeah! What, so I just tell her the truth?
Yes. No. No.
Because… Because if I told her the truth,
then she'd just throw her dreams out the window
to come out here and be with me. And I… I just can't take that.
Like, you know?
Like, this… this huge knot of resentment would build,
like… like some cancer,
until eventually she hates me.
And then, before you know it, we're just like my mom and dad.
We're divorced, my kids hate me. Shit!
Yeah, shit! I mean, it's all shit.
The cycle never ends.
Yeah, man. Your nightmare cycle.
You want it to stop, but what is your approach here?
To just slowmotion break up with Nancy?
I guess. No, man!
I know. I don't know what to do.
Palm Tree Delight! That's what you do.
Palm Tree Delight? Go, go. Go.
Ándale, ándale.
Really? Okay. Ándale. Arriba, arriba. Let's go!
Backpack in the back of the van.
Go!
Got me stressed out. It's not even my girlfriend.
Mmhmm, mmhmm, mmhmm.
Yup, mine's better.
No, it isn't.
Milkshakes?
Yum.
Where, oh where have you been hiding this handsome thing?
Uh,
Angela, thi… this is Mike,
my boyfriend.
Angela. Pleasure.
Heard a lot about you.
It's really cool to finally meet some of El Jane's friends.
Friends?
Yeah.
Super cool.
Come on, friend.
Let's skate, shall we?
I wanted to finish I'll hold that.
Come on.
Whoo!
Why are you so nervous?
We're just having fun.
Oh no. What?
El, she hasn't been telling you everything.
What you talking about? She's lying to you.
Bullshit. No, listen to me.
She's having problems here. Problems. Okay, what kind of problems?
Stay put.
All right, everyone.

Okay, you are now calling from Durham, North Carolina.
But if this is KGB, they will still be able to trace us eventually,
so keep it brief.
How brief?
A minute, max, and…
Proof of life. Got it.
Okay.
One, two…
This is Enzo.
Hello, Enzo?
This is Joyce.
I received your message,
and I would like to make a reservation. Yes, good, good.
But for reservation, you need to make deposit.
Uh, what… what kind of deposit?
Forty thousand dollars.
You have it in Hopper's trust, for the girl, yes?
Uh, yes. Yes. Forty thousand.
Good.
Bring to Yuri's Fish n' Fly in Nome, Alaska.
Uh, you want me to go to Alaska?
Yes.
You give Yuri money, Yuri gets me money,
I give him your friend.
Simple trade, understand?
Uh…
…uh, first, we… we're gonna have to speak to Hopper.
We need to know he's alive.
Hey!
I'm afraid not possible.
Why not?
Your friend is, uh, stuck.
But you give me money, I make him unstuck.
You must trust me.
How do I trust you? I don't know who you are.
Forty thousand. Yuri's Fish n' Fly. Two days. Do not call again.
Well, that wasn't the KGB.
But it wasn't a friend either.
So we're both wrong.
Who the hell was that?
Still alive.
But he is barely breathing.
More of this, he will die.
You are strong, American.
Perhaps the Motherland could use that strength.
Send him to Kamchatka!
I never knew you to be generous.
You clearly do not know Kamchatka, Doctor.
This man does not deserve the peace of death.
So I have sent him...
to Hell.
Present arms.
Lieutenant Colonel, welcome to Indiana.
Eddie Munson.
He's a part of that freak devil cult, Hellfire.
The cops, they say Chrissy went to him to buy drugs.
Drugs? No.
That's what I said. Chrissy would never touch that shit.
They wouldn't even show her parents her face.
I don't know what this freak did to Chrissy, but he did something sick.
Probably sacrificed her, drained her blood for the devil.
Satanists do that. That's what I'm saying. It's this cult.
Hellfire isn't a cult.
It's… It's just a D & D club.
D… D & D?
Dungeons & Dragons?
It's like a… It's like a game. It… It's fantasy.
And how exactly is it you know all of that, Sinclair?
Uh…
well, it's my sister.
Yeah, she's like… She's like, a total nerd.
You know? Yeah.
Nerds? Like, she plays a lot sometimes
I'm sure your sister isn't killing people, right?
But I've read the wrong person plays this game, it can warp their mind.
They confuse fantasy and reality, and innocent people die.
Been happening all over the country. It's an epidemic.
I've read about that shit. It's real.
And I think Eddie…
He's the wrong type of person, right?
You know, he got lost.
He thought Chrissy was just a part of his… his sick game.
And chances are, he's still in the game. Meaning
He's gonna kill again.
But not if we can help it.
Would Chrissy want us to just stand by
while the cops go around pursuing some bullshit leads,
spreading rumors saying she's some druggy?
No! No, she'd want us to go out there.
To do something about it, wouldn't she? Yeah!
Then let's hunt some freak! Yeah!
For Chrissy! Yeah!
Let's go! Yeah!

Have you seen or heard from Eddie recently?
Eddie Munson.
When's the last time you talked to him? Seen him?
Okay. Sorry to bother you. Know anyone who'd know where he is?
I really don't think he's at the arcade. Yep, I'm pretty sure.
Reefer Rick? No. Does this Reefer Rick have a last name? I mean, it's kind of…
All right, Doctor Zhivago.
It's a double VHS. It's long.
But that's because it's filled with action and romance,
and a little bit of suspense.
So, my boyfriend won't, like, totally puke when I bring it home?
Oh, you… your boyfriend?
Uh, no. No. He's gonna…
He's gonna love it.
Yeah.
See ya. Yeah, see ya later.
Alligator.
Goddammit.
Hey, guys, I might have a lead.
Seriously? Yeah.
Apparently, Eddie gets drugs from some guy named Reefer Rick,
and sometimes Eddie crashes there.
Sounds promising. Where does Reefer Rick live?
See, that's the thing. No one knows.
He's more of a… a legend than someone that people actually know.
Last name? I don't know that either.
Bet the cops know the last name.
What? Cops.
I mean, listen, if this Reefer Rick is actually a drug dealer,
I guarantee you he's been busted at some point.
Means he's in the system. The cops?
Really, Steve? That's your suggestion?
I think they should be filled in on what we know, what's going on.
You think Eddie's guilty, don't you? Whoa.
I believe in innocent until proven guilty, all that constitutional shit.
I just, you know,
don't think we can rule it out.
That's precisely what we're trying to do here, Steve.
And maybe we'd have a little bit more luck
if you spent less time trying to find a girlfriend
and more time trying to find Eddie.
Somebody has to attend to the customers. Especially if they're babes, right?
Hey, not fair. Okay?
I attend to all customers equally, babes and nonbabes alike.
We've got a very big selection in here. It can be super overwhelming for people.
Yeah, it can be.
What are you doing? Maybe we don't need a last name.
Twelve Ricks have accounts here. Lot of Ricks.
So, let's narrow it down.

I've talked to enough reporters. Yeah.
Okay, well…
What about that one? With the flag?
Yeah, I tried them twice. They were actually quite rude.
I am not doing that again.
I'm telling you, we've talked to everyone.
Nope. Not everyone.
Hi there. Hi. Did you see something last night, huh?
Oh, you wanna tell us everything?
Nancy, come on. Let's get outta here.
But he's just the cutest little witness.
Stay here.
Hi.
Uh, I'm a friend of Max Mayfield's, over there.
You're Wayne Munson, aren't you?
Eddie's uncle?
That's right.
I heard you found the body.
The neighbors, they were Like to gossip.
And I'm not interested in gossiping no more.
Certainly not to a reporter.
What gave me away?
Look, let me level with you, Mr. Munson.
The paper that I write for is… small.
We don't have the staff to keep up with the big guys.
And I'm just… looking for something,
anything really, about what happened last night.
Why?
Far as I can tell, you all have it figured out already.
My nephew's a freak.
He killed that girl.
Ain't that about right?
Let me guess.
You've been speaking to the Hawkins Post?
Chuck Bailey?
Yeah, I used to work with him.
I mean, that guy doesn't know his ass from his elbow.
Let me tell your side of the story.
My nephew,
he may look dangerous,
but he didn't do this.
It just… ain't in his nature.
No matter what anyone says,
and they will say things, believe you me.
But…
this… wasn't Eddie.
The man who did this…
who killed that poor girl,
he's…
pure evil.
"""Man""?"
You think you know who might've done this?
You ever hear the name
Victor Creel?
I guess you're too young, but back when I was a kid,
everybody knew the name Victor Creel.
He lost his mind.
Killed his whole family.
Kids and wife.
Took their eyes.
Cut 'em right out.
God.
That poor girl I found this morning,
same exact thing.
So I'm thinking
maybe he broke out.
Victor Creel is still alive?
They locked him away in Pennhurst Asylum.
Yeah, as far as I know, he's still there.
That is, unless he broke out.
Like that… What's his name? White mask and killed the babysitters?
Michael Myers?
Yeah, Michael Myers.
You ask me, Victor's like that.
He's a real boogeyman.
Um, I'll be right back.
Fred?
Fred!
Fred!
Fred?
Fred?
Murderer.
Murderer!
Murderer. Murderer! Murderer.
Murderer.
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!
Murderer! Murderer!
Murderer!
You are no longer men.
You are cogs in a machine.
A machine in service of our great Motherland.

you will be hunted down.
You will be captured.
And then you will suffer greatly
as you perform your final act
for the Motherland.
There will be no second chances.
Run,
you die.
You hear, American?
Your friend is… stuck.
But you get me money, I make him unstuck.
You must trust me.
How do I trust
Joyce, whoever Enzo is, the answer is not on that tape.
[woman speaking Russian indistinctly on tape]
You don't hear that? In the background?
So he's outside.
Someone's talking. Not surprising.
I think she's talking to Enzo.
Play it again.
[woman speaking Russian indistinctly on tape]
Can you translate that?
Uh, I… I can't understand it. It's too low.
Hey!
But you get me money, I make him unstuck.
Turn it up. You must trust me.
How do I trust you? I don't know who you are.
She… She wants to use the phone.
She's mad at Enzo.
"Calls him a ""moosor."" ""Moosor""?"
It's slang. For what?
"Literally, ""moosor"" translates to trash or garbage."
"Like ""pig"" here, often directed at cops."
Cops?
Or guards.
Hopper's stuck.
And Enzo can get him unstuck.
Yeah. It's not exactly the Ritz, is it?
Welcome to your new home, American.
Enzo's a prison guard.
Maybe Hopper bribed him.
Sounds like Jim, doesn't it?
Joyce, where are you going? Bank.
I'm gonna get Enzo his damn money,
and we are getting Hopper back.
Okay.
El?
What the hell? Get out!
Not there? No.
Should've told me she was having trouble. I didn't know they were gonna be here.
You knew she was having trouble for a year and didn't tell me.
I didn't know she was lying to you. Which is why you were a douche all day?
I wasn't being a douche. You were.
You were rolling your eyes, moping. You were barely talking.
You basically sabotaged the whole day. She was lying to you.
Straight to your face, ever since you got here.
And I've been a total third wheel all day. It's been miserable.
So, sorry if I wasn't… wasn't smiling.
Yeah, whatever, man.
Well, what about us?
What?
You're mad that I didn't talk to you?
You made it super clear that you're not interested in anything I have to say.
That's just not true. You've called maybe a couple times.
It's been a year, Mike.
Meanwhile, El has a book of letters from you.
That's because she's my girlfriend, Will. And us?
We're friends. We're friends.
We used to be best friends.
Then maybe you should've reached out more. I don't know.
But why is this on me?
Why… Why am I the bad guy?
Let's just… Let's just find her. Okay?
Yeah.
Oh my God, her face. Right?
She looks like she shit herself. Yeah.
Angela.
Uhoh. Look who it is. She looks upset.
You ruined my day.
Oh no. Did we embarrass you in front of your boyfriend?
I want you to say sorry to me,
and I want you to tell my boyfriend that it was just a joke
and that we are really friends.
Or what?
You gonna hurt us with your mean stare again?
Sorry you can't cry to teacher today.
You'll just have to cry to your daddy instead.
Oh, wait. Can't do that either.
Hey!
Angela.
Holy shit. Angela, you okay?
Angela, hey. You okay? Oh my God!
What did she do? Oh my God.
Oh my God, what do we do? Oh, shit.
You're okay. You're okay.
Oh… Oh my God.
Holy shit, El.
What did you do?
What did you do?
What have you done? What have you done?
Okay. Well, that's settled. I guess he's not here.
Eddie! It's Dustin! Great.
Look, we just wanna talk, okay?
No cops, I swear. We just wanna help.
Eddie!
Shh.
Rick!
Reefer Rick!
Don't scream that.
Rick! He's not there.
Reefer Rick! Just…
He could just be really high.
Is that a foot? No, that's a shoe.
Hey, guys?
Hello?
Is anyone home?
What a dump.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
He might be in here.
So take the tarp off.
If you're so brave, you take the tarp off.
Hey, look over here.
Someone was here.
Maybe he heard us. Got spooked and ran.
Don't worry. Steve will get him with his oar.
I know you think you're being funny,
but considering everyone in this room has nearly died a hundred times,
personally, I don't find it funny in the slight
Whoa!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eddie! Eddie! Stop!
Eddie! Eddie!
It's me.
It's Dustin.
This is Steve.
He's not gonna hurt you, right, Steve?
Right. Yeah.
Steve, why don't you drop the oar?
He's cool. He's cool.
I'm cool, man. I'm cool.
What are you doing here? We're looking for you.
We're here to help.
Eddie, these are my friends.
You know Robin, from band.
This is my friend Max.
The one who never wants to play D & D.
Eddie.
We're on your side.
I swear on my mother.
Right, guys? Yes. Yes. We swear.
On Dustin's mother.
Yeah, Dustin's… Dustin's mother.
Jesus Ch…
Eddie…
We just want to talk.
Okay?
We want to know what happened.
You won't believe me.
Try us.
Fred!
Fred!
Excuse me.
Hi.
Excuse me, sorry. Have you seen my friend wandering around?
Uh, nerdy, glasses, scar on his face?
No, sorry.
Hi, officer?
Officer? What are you still doing here?
My… My friend from the car earlier, I… I can't find him.
What do you mean?
He was there and then he was just gone and…
Did you maybe see him leave with somebody or…?
I told you kids to go home. Jesus Christ.
This is Glenn. We might have a situation here.
Her body just, like,
lifted up into the air and, uh…
And she just, like, hung there.
In the air.
And her bones… Uh, she…
Her bones started to snap.
Her eyes, man.
It… It was like there was something,
like, inside her head, pulling.
I… I didn't know what to do, so I…
I ran away.
I left her there.
You all think I'm crazy, right?
No. We don't think you're crazy.
Don't bullshit me, man! I know how this sounds.
We're not bullshitting you. We believe you.
Look,
what I'm about to tell you might be
a little… difficult to take.
Okay.
You know how people say Hawkins is…
cursed?
They're not
way off.
There's another world.
A world hidden beneath Hawkins.
Sometimes it bleeds into ours.
Like ghosts and shit?
There are some things
worse than ghosts.
Help me!
No, no, no…
These monsters from this other world…
Help! Somebody! …we thought they were gone.
Nancy, please! But they've come back before.
That's why we needed to find you.
If they're back again, we need to know.
Fred.
That night,
did you see anything?
Dark particles, maybe?
It would almost look like dust, swirling dust.
No, man, there was nothing you could see or, uh…
or touch.
What do you want?
I want you
to join me.
No, no, no, no.
You know, I tried to wake her, man.
She couldn't move.
It was like she… she was in a trance or something.
Or under a spell.
A curse.
Vecna's curse.
Who's Vecna?
An undead creature of great power.
A spell caster.
A dark wizard.
Sam.
There were no signs of any attacker. No bruises.
No signs of any struggle.
It's as if her attacker was a ghost.
Does this remind you of anything, Doctor?
No, it doesn't.
Are you sure?
Why are you here?
Really.
I'd like your opinion.
I was fired, in case you forgot.
A foreign government invaded our country, all under your watch.
There had to be consequences. Certainly you understand that.
What I understand is that something… something is going on in that town
that nobody… nobody fully comprehends.
And I also understand that military strength is not the answer.
So what is the answer, Doctor?
More scientists?
Because it was men of science, men like you,
who created this problem in the first place.
Everything that has happened in Hawkins
can be traced back to Brenner's little pet.
Wouldn't you agree?
Dr. Brenner trained her for this very thing.
Remote assassinations.
What you're suggesting is impossible.
Is it? Eleven is dead.
I'm not convinced. So, where has she been all this time?
There are rumors she's alive
and receiving help from someone on the inside.
Are you saying I'm helping her? Is that what you're saying?
If I wanted to chat, Doctor, I would've picked up the damn phone.
Now, you can make this easy and tell us where she is, or…
we can do this the hard way.
Not in here. Go! Go! Go!
Move! Nothing.
Why are you taking that box?
Those are Peter's old school projects.
You do not need those. Hey!
I'm talking to you!
Sam, do something.
I wanna know everything he's done,
everyone he's spoken to in the past year.
And if we're lucky,
he'll lead us right to the girl.
Can you tell me your name?
Um, Angela. Angela.
Do you know where you are, Angela?
Um, Rink… RinkOMania, I think? RinkOMania. Very good.
Now, where does it hurt, sweetie? My head.
Your head hurts?
And my nose.
I can't breathe.
Just try to take some deep breaths.
Breathe slow for me, okay? That's it.
I know it's a lot of blood, but you're going to be okay.
I don't think so. I promise.
Just need you to answer a few more questions, all right?
Okay.
No.
I don't know.
I know this may be, like, upsetting and shit,
but that future prom queen is gonna be fine.
It's just, like, rubber wheels.
Plastic. Oh.
Not like hard plastic. Just…
Just the soft kind. Totally.
But you ever wonder why the wheels aren't wood, man?
Or metal?
So people don't get hurt when they get shmacked.
Oh. Yeah.
Because it happens more than you think, man.
Rollerskate attacks.
Man. Hey, at least it wasn't an ice skate.
That nose would've been sliced clean off, man.
It could've been so much worse. So much worse.
In the grand scheme of things, it's just a little blip.
That's a funny word, man.
"""Blip."""
"""Blip."" ""Blip."""
Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.
Mom?
Well, well! Aren't you lot a sight for sore eyes, huh?
Hi, Murray. You kids like risotto?
Yeah.
There I was, headed down the I5, going to see a client in Ventura.
I'm looking for a motel to stay for the night,
and suddenly, bam, it hits me.
"""Didn't the Byers move here?"""
Small world, isn't it? It's a small world.
"So I thought, ""Hey, you know what?"""
"""Why don't I drop in, say hello to my old friends?"""
It's so sweet of you.
Sweeter of you to let me stay. And he cooks.
Mm, and cleans. A regular little housewife.
You should stay.
I'd be tempted, Joyce, except, you know, you have that, uh…
Right, that business trip.
Business trip? What business trip?
Oh my gosh. I almost forgot to tell you guys.
This thing came up at work… Can you pass me the olive oil?
That's wine.
And it turns out I have to go to a conference tomorrow. In Alaska.
Alaska? Tomorrow?
Crazy, right?
That's where they're based, the Britannicas.
Joan and Brian Britannica.
Mm.
So do Eskimos, like, still live in igloos,
or, uh, are they, like, fullyblown, like, living in the… in the suburbs now?
Who is this?
So, Jonathan,
this means you're gonna have to, you know, take charge while I'm gone.
Yeah. Wait.
What?
What's going on?
Oh my… Your mom's going to Alaska.
You're going to Alaska?
Mmhmm.
What's going on in Alaska? The Britannicas are there.
The Britannicas? Mmhmm.
Jonathan, what is wrong with you?
I think I know what's wrong with him. We just had a super stressful day.
Stress, huh?
This girl got shmacked in the head today at the roller rink.
Shmacked? Yeah, one of those vicious skate attacks.
A skate attack? Yeah, but it wasn't an ice skate. It was…
It was a plastic skate. No, it was, like, rubber.
Rubber. Rubber.
Rubber. You know what? I'm not sure.
Anyway, she looked like she's gonna be fine.
She's totally fine. She didn't look fine.
El, aren't you gonna finish your
What…?
What is going on, you guys?
Okay, I, uh, I sense tension.
Is it the risotto? Everyone hates the risotto?
Absolutely not. No, it's incredible. Mmmm.
This risotto is shmackin', dude.
Still have no idea who he is.
What did you do?
What did you do?
Angela!
What have you done?
What have you done?
He sees all this? He sees us?
He'll shit his pants and cry for Mommy. This guy's no fighter.
Hope he tries something. Gives me a reason.
Hell, yeah.
Well, well, look who's decided to join.
What are you guys doing?
We're gearing up. Preparing for the hunt.
Hey, man. Relax.
We're not killers like Eddie.
We just wanna talk to him.
Get him to admit his crime.
Yeah, a little friendly neighborhood chat.
Hey.
You didn't know Chris.
If you're not up to this, you can go home. There's no judgment.
You'll still be one of us, all right?
No.
I'm good.
I wanna help.
All right.
Let's capture us a freak.
Shit.
Oh shit.
Jesus…
Delivery service.
So we got, uh, some good news and some bad news.
How do you prefer it? Bad news first, always.
All right. Bad news.
We tapped into the Hawkins PD dispatch with our Cerebro,
and they're definitely looking for you.
Also, they're, uh, pretty convinced you killed Chrissy.
Like, 100% kind of convinced.
And the good news? Your name hasn't gone public yet.
But if we found out about you, it's a matter of time before others do.
And once that gets out, everyone and their shallowminded mother
is gonna be gunning for you.
Hunt the freak, right?
Exactly. Shit.
So, before that happens,
we find Vecna, kill him, and prove your innocence.
That's all, Dustin? That's all?
Yeah, no, that's pretty much it.
Listen, Eddie,
I know everything Dustin is saying sounds totally delusional,
but we've actually been through this before.
I mean, they have a… a few times,
and… and I have once.
Mine was more humanfleshbased, theirs was more smokerelated,
but bottom line is, collectively, I really feel we got this.
We usually rely on this girl who has super powers.
But, uh, those went byebye, so… So we're technically in more of the
Kinda… Brainstorming phase.
Brainstorming.
There… There's nothing to worry about.
Shit. Tarp.
Tarp. Tarp.
And after you talked to Wayne, what happened?
I heard barking from the dog,
and then… he was just gone.
See anyone lurking about? Who looks like they shouldn't be there?
No. No, no, there was nobody there.
"""Nobody."" I already told this to Officer Daniels."
Did you look into Victor Creel?
Sorry, what's that? Victor Creel.
Wayne got it in her head that the old nut did this.
Victor's locked away. Don't need to worry about him, all right?
Now, you said last you saw Fred,
he was by the picnic tables.
Do I have that right?
Ms. Wheeler.
He was by the picnic tables. Is that correct?
Ms. Wheeler?
Does the picnic table ring a bell?
Whoo!
Hey, guys, there is a 4:00 p.m. showing of Police Academy 3.
Could be fun.
Maybe we just stay home today.
What is this? You guys just gonna mope around all break?
No one's moping. It's just the movie is supposed to suck.
It…
Hey, El.
I, uh, made you some Eggos, but they're getting kinda cold.
Hey, that's cool. Hop's cabin, right?
So, um, are we just not gonna talk about it?
About what?
I don't know, just maybe, like, about yesterday or…
everything.
There's nothing to say.
Yeah, I guess, um…
I guess I'm just a little, uh…
Guess I don't really understand.
Why didn't you tell me what's going on here?
I mean, you know I'm not exactly Mr. Popularity back at home.
I mean, you've seen it. I've been bullied my entire life.
I mean, I… I know what it's like.
No.
You don't.
Okay.
What don't I understand?
I am different.
I do not belong.
You mean in Lenora?
Anywhere.
Come on, you… you can't actually believe that.
Everyone looks at me like…
like I'm a monster.
They just don't know you.
You think I'm a monster too.
What?
Yesterday.
The way you looked at me.
You… You were scared of me.
No. No. No, that's not… That's… That's not true.
I was surprised.
Maybe I was a little upset in the moment, but, I mean…
I'm sorry. I just… I didn't know what to do.
I mean, it just was so crazy. It happened so fast.
But it doesn't change anything. It doesn't matter.
I… I care for you…
so much.
"""Care."""
But you don't… you don't love me anymore?
What… Who… Who said that I didn't?
You never say it.
I say it.
You can't even write it, Mike.
"""From Mike."" ""From Mike."" ""From Mike."""
"""From Mike."" ""From."""
Okay, okay. Eleven, you're being ridiculous.
What, like… What is this?
You know what I think of you.
You're the most incredible person in the world.
And you can't let these mouth breathers ruin you. Ruin us.
I mean, they're nobodies.
They're nobodies.
And you're a superhero.
Not anymore.
Ten bucks says Mom forgot something.
Yeah.
I'm not taking that bet.
Hi, does Jane Hopper live here?
Uh, yeah. Um, what is this about?
Is Jane's father or mother around?
Uh, no. No, her mom's out of town.
I'm her brother. Um, stepbrother. But, uh…
I'm sorry, what… uh, what is this about?
You may or may not be aware of an incident involving Jane at the RinkOMania.
That was an accident.
A warrant says otherwise. A warrant?
Come on, that's crazy. That doesn't need to happen.
Hey there.
You Jane Hopper?
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
Can you please tell us where you're taking her?
Are the cuffs really necessary?
Officers, answer me.
Eleven. Eleven, listen to me. Okay?
Eleven, will you please look at me?
Everything's gonna be fine.
I am going to fix this. Okay?
Just… Just stay calm and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?
Just… All you have to do is trust me.
I promise. I'm gonna get you out. I promise!
Has Mom's flight left yet? Shit.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign.
Please make sure your seat belts are securely fastened.
Do you think I should've just told them?
What? Told who?
The kids.
About Hopper.
It… It just felt so wrong to lie to them like that.
Mm. Right, right, right.
Well…
…I'm not exactly an expert in parenting.
But, for what little it's worth, I think you did the right thing.
The responsible thing.
Responsible.
Your children, bless their mischievous souls…
…they like to get involved.
This way, what? They play too much Nintendo,
eat too much junk food, smoke some ganja,
pound some beers,
experiment sexually.
What's the worst that can happen?
Excuse me, ma'am?
Sorry to interrupt, but you're gonna need to fasten your seat belt.
Of course. Mm.
Buckle up.
Like this is really gonna save me if we crash.
What is this, American?
What is taking you this long? Are you tired today?
Pig.
What do you say?
Asshole!
Your Russian is getting better.
So is your acting.
All right. Come on, what is it?
I bring news from America.
I heard from your friends.
They're bringing your money to Alaska.
When?
Today, I hope.
If my pilot gets the money, he will bring it in his plane tomorrow.
Then you can hitch a ride back to your country.
I get rich,
and you're a free man.
Sound too good to be true, yes? It does.
This pilot, you sure you can trust him?
His name is Yuri Ismaylov. He's a smuggler.
Supplies American goods to some of us guards here,
including me on lucky occasions.
Cigarettes, peanut butter, Playboys,
the best America has to offer.
Great. So he's a criminal. Of course.
Who else do you want to do this job? Gandhi?
You're worried about your woman, is that it?
I can see why you like her, American.
When I talked to her,
I can tell by voice that she's very pretty.
Feisty too. I like that.
Shame we won't meet.
You promised me that she would be safe.
And she will be.
Let me handle Yuri.
You have more important things to worry about.
Remember, you miss that plane tomorrow,
I am still rich,
and you're still stuck in Kamchatka.
So whatever it is you're planning, American,
best get to it, yes?
Antonov!
Finish with your American toy, we need him on the tracks.
Yes, yes. I am just putting him in his place.
Nosy bastard.
Where do you want it?
You're saying that this thing that killed Fred and Chrissy,
it's from the Upside Down? If the shoe fits.
Our working theory is that he attacks with a spell
or a curse.
Now, whether or not he's doing the bidding of the Mind Flayer
or just loves killing teens, we don't know.
All we know is this is something different.
Something new. Doesn't make sense.
It's only a theory.
No, Fred and Chrissy don't make sense.
I mean, why them?
Maybe they were just in the wrong place.
Were both at the game. And near the trailer park.
We're at the trailer park.
Uh, should we maybe not be here?
There is something about this place.
Fred started acting weird the second we got here.
Acting weird as in…?
Scared,
on edge,
upset.
Max said Chrissy was upset too.
Yeah, but not here.
She was crying in the bathroom at school.
Serial killers stalk their prey before they strike, right?
So, maybe Fred and Chrissy saw this Vecman
Vecna. Dunno about you,
but if I saw some freaky wizard monster,
I would mention it to someone.
Maybe they did.
I saw Chrissy leaving Ms. Kelley's office.
If you saw a monster, you… you wouldn't go to the police. They'd never believe you.
But you might go to your Your shrink.
Whoa, whoa, Nance. Nance!
Where you going?
Oh, there's just something I wanna check on first.
Something you wanna share with us?
I don't wanna waste your time. It's a real shot in the dark.
Yeah, okay. Are you out of your mind?
Flying solo with Vecna on the loose?
No, it's too dangerous. You need… You need someone to…
Here. I'll stick with Nance.
Take the car, check out the shrink.
Don't think you want me driving your car. Why?
I don't have a license. Why?
I'm poor.
I can drive. No, never again. Please.
Anybody but you. No.
No chance. Come on.
No. All right, okay. This is stupid.
Us ladies will stick together.
Unless you think we need you to protect us.
Be careful.
Just gonna stand there and gawk? Shut up.
Why don't we go? Okay? Shut up and get in the car.
Wipe your feet.
On the outside, not the inside.
Always the babysitter.
Always the goddamn babysitter!
Hey there, fatass. I said leave me alone!
Can I say no? I can't say no. He'll leave me.
It's just a cough. Doctors are wrong.
She can't force me to go to that awful place.
She wouldn't do that to me.
I'll just tell them I fell again. I slipped. An accident.
You're out drinking again?
Look at me. You're an embarrassment to this family.
Goddamn disgrace.
Patrick, your nose.
Huh? Your nose is bleeding, dude.
God, gross.
Well, well, well, what do we have here?
You're a little early, fellas.
Show's not till next week.
Oh, that was music? We're looking for Eddie.
He's in this band, if that's what you call this.
What do you care?
That's our business.
Lucas?
What are you doing with these douchebags?
You know these freaks, Sinclair?
Uh, they know my sister.
They tried to recruit me to their…
club, cult.
Lucas, what the hell?
We're just trying to find Eddie, man.
Well, you have eyes, don't you? He's not here.
Hey, man! Hey!
Hey!
Where is he? I don't know!
Where is he? I don't know!
Hey, let him go, man! Let him go!
It's gonna be hard to play drums with a broken hand.
Dustin!
What? Dustin Henderson!
What? Dustin Henderson!
Man, he was…
he was calling around looking for Eddie. Maybe he found him!
See? That wasn't so hard, was it? Now…
"where do we find this ""Dustin""?"
That's when you struck her?
I'm gonna need you to give me a verbal response.
Yes.
That… That is when I hit her.
And why did you hit her?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You know, the girl you hit, she got a grade 2 concussion.
Did you know that?
No.
She doesn't seem that upset about it, does she?
No, she doesn't.
No, she doesn't.
Did you wanna kill her?
I don't know.
You didn't know if you wanted to kill her?
No.
No, you didn't want to kill her, or no, you don't know?
I don't know.
Turn to the right.
Jane Hopper.
Okay, yes, I see her now. It looks like she's still being processed.
Okay. So, uh, what does that mean exactly?
They're putting her in the system.
After, she'll be transferred to juvenile hall.
What? Jail? You're gonna put her in jail?
A detention hall for juveniles.
That's jail.
Hey, look, is there any chance we can just see her?
Are you a parent or guardian? No, but
Well, we're her brothers, and we're family.
That's not enough. You have to be a parent or legal guardian.
You have to be kidding. Ridiculous.
That's the law. You're not gonna change it complaining to me.
You want to see Jane?
Find your mother.
Thank you.
It's bullshit. Such bullshit. I mean, she wasn't even trying to help.
Then what do we do? I don't know.
I guess we have to wait for Mom to land in Alaska.
Then she's gonna be in jail?
Yeah, I don't know. Hey!
Hey! Hey, Mike!
Hey, stop the car! What are you doing?
Oh no.
Oh no.
All right. And here you go.
Thank you. Um, how much longer?
Oh, just a few more hours. Almost there.
Okay.
You and your husband have exciting plans?
Um, we're seeing an old friend.
How fun.
One person, one piece. Don't you understand?!
I said one piece per person!
I am no fairy.
No, no.
You…
...hit.
You…
...hit.
I give bread.
I will break your leg.
You…
...hit.
I give bread.
And soup.
Crazy American.
Now.
Again.
Help me get this straight.
Eddie's uncle, Wayne,
thinks that Victor Creel escaped from Pennhurst Asylum
and that he's the one running around committing these murders?
Pretty much.
But Victor committed the eyeball murders, like, way back in the '50s.
Well, '59.
So, that means these murders predate Eleven in the Upside Down
by about 30 years?
Yeah.
Which makes spooky Victor Creel like 70 years old.
Yep.
So, he's a grandpa murderer
who can turn invisible and lift people into the air.
It doesn't make sense. I know.
That's why I said it was a shot in the dark.
"I know. I just thought that by ""shot in the dark,"""
you were being modest or hiding something super solid up your sleeve
that you were gonna wow us with later.
But this is really, truly a shot in the dark.
Like, we are snipers with blindfolds on who've been spun around 50 times.
Coming!
Hi. Sorry, we're in a bit of a rush.
Could we get the keys to the basement archives?
Of course. Give me one sec.
Did I come off mean or condescending?
No. Right.
Sorry. It's just, you seem annoyed.
You don't know me well.
I don't really have a filter or a strong grasp of social cues.
Okay. If I say something that upsets you,
just know that I know it's a flaw. Believe me, my mother reminds me daily.
Got it. All right, ladies.
Here you go. Have fun.
Yep. We'll try.
Max. Hi.
Hi. I'm so sorry to bother you over break,
but… do you have a minute to talk?
Um, yeah, of course. Of course.
Okay. She's in.
I'm missing collarbones, not eyes.
So,
we gonna talk about… it?
Huh? Sorry, talk about what?
Your temporary insanity earlier today
when you basically threw yourself at Nance?
That's not what happened. Pretty sure that's what happened.
It was public. There were a lot of witnesses.
You implying I still have a thing for Nance?
No. I'm not implying.
I'm stating. And, as it relates to your steadfast refusal to date Robin,
it's pretty much the only logical explanation.
That's not the only one.
And as for Nance,
I was just trying to protect a friend.
A friend, Henderson. Okay? Okay.
Don't wanna find her with her eyes sucked out of her skull
by this Vecna creep.
You're bright red in the face right now.
I'm not. I don't wanna talk about it.
I'll punch you so hard your teeth will fall back out.
Whoa. Too far.
Not cool. Sorry. Not cool. It's okay.
It's just, with everything that's happening,
with all the murders,
it's… it's making everything worse again.
You've experienced trauma, Max,
and when you keep your feelings, your pain, bottled up the way you do,
it doesn't take much to trigger them again.
So now, when it rains, it storms.
Yeah, I know.
Do you think you're ready to talk more about that night?
Billy!
I live next door to where it happened.
I'm sorry?
To where Chrissy was murdered.
The cops asked me a bunch of questions.
Did they talk to you?
I mean, I know you were seeing Chrissy.
Max, you know I can't talk about Chrissy
or any other student.
Yeah, but, I mean,
what if there was a serial killer on the loose in my neighborhood?
Did Chrissy mention anything?
Anything about who might have done this?
Max, I'm… I'm sorry, I… I really can't discuss this.
You wouldn't want me talking to any other students about you, right?
If I were dead and it would help catch the killer, then yeah,
I most definitely would.
Well, let's leave that up to the police, shall we?
Yeah, you're right.
The police totally have this under control.
Can I use the bathroom? Sure.
Up the stairs, to the left.
Thanks.
Here she comes. Here she comes.
What'd she say? Nothing, just drive.
Steve, drive. Okay.
No one's home.
So, now what? We keep looking.
The town's not that big.
Only so many places these freaks can burrow.
Where the hell is Sinclair?
Dustin.
It's Lucas. Do you copy? Dustin.
Lucas? Where the hell have you been?
Just listen.
Are you looking for Eddie?
We found him, no thanks to you.
You found him? A boathouse on Coal Mill Road.
Don't worry. He's safe.
You guys know he killed Chrissy, right?
That's bullshit.
Eddie tried to save Chrissy.
Then why do all the cops say he did it?
Lucas, you're so behind it's ridiculous, okay?
Just meet us at school. We'll explain later.
I… I can't.
I think some real bad shit's about to go down.
What are you talking about? What bad shit?
Sinclair!
Lucas? Lucas?
What the hell were you doing?
I was… I was looking for clues. Clues?
What, freshman think he's Sherlock Holmes or something?
Yo, let's go.
I found one.
What?
A clue.
I know where Eddie's hiding.
What did you do? What have you done?
You transporting a Jane Hopper? Yeah, what is this?
I'll take her off your hands.
No! No!
Hey, kiddo.
Come on. We're here.
Huh? Come on.
Oh, shit.
Welcome to Alaska.
Welcome to Alaska.
Oh, God. This is spring?
Welcome to Alaska.
Welcome to Alaska.
Welcome to Alaska.
Welcome to Alaska.
Next!
Next prisoner!
Anything… juicy over there?
Nothing new.
Yep, same here.
Victor seemed like a normal guy.
Dead family, missing eyes,
took a plea deal, sent to Pennhurst.
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
What are we looking for exactly?
Nance?
Any mention of dark wizards or alternate dimensions?
Things in that vein?
I don't know. Okay?
It's starting to seem like this was just a big waste of time.
You're obviously bored. Why don't you call Steve?
I'm sure he'll pick you up.
And I mean, I'm not really in danger here, so…
You do know that Steve and I are, like, totally not a thing, right?
What?
So, I figure you and Jonathan are still going strong
'cause you guys are going to college together.
You're one of those unstoppable power couples, but I… I just…
I wanted to make sure that you knew
that Steve and I are just friends.
Like, platonic with a capital P.
Just in case that's adding any tension between us.
It wasn't.
Holy shit. The Weekly Watcher. I can't believe they have this.
Don't they write about, like, Bigfoot and UFOs?
First, UFOs are absolutely real. Bigfoot I'm still on the fence about.
But may I remind you we are looking for information on dark wizards?
If someone's gonna write about that, it's gonna be these weirdos.
Ah.
"""Elvis cloned by aliens."""
You never know.
"""Victor Creel claims vengeful demon killed family."""
"""The murder that shocked a small community."""
Ha, ha. That's very funny.
I'm not kidding.
Get over here.
"""According to several insiders,"
"Victor believed his house was haunted by an ancient demon."""
"""Victor allegedly hired a priest to exorcise the demon from his home."""
Pretty novel for the '50s. Exorcist wasn't out yet.
Keep… Keep going.
Okay, so Victor claimed this exorcism failed,
but it angered this demon,
which then murdered his family, removing their eyes.
Victor believed he was spared as a punishment.
That's pretty convenient for Victor.
Yeah, or super inconvenient.
Victor was declared legally insane by the court, right? What if this is why?
It sounds insane. Just didn't go public because
The plea bargain. The records were sealed.
What if a demon did invade Victor's home?
It's just, this demon wasn't any old demon.
It was Vecna.
Dustin, do you copy? Yeah, I copy.
So, Nancy's a genius.
Vecna's first victims date back all the way to 1959.
Her shot in the dark was a bull'seye.
Okay, that's totally bonkers, but I can't really talk right now.
What are you doing?
Breaking and entering school
to retrieve confidential and extremely personal files.
Can you repeat that?
Just get your ass over here, stat.
We'll explain everything.
Thought they were talking to Ms. Kelley. We leave them alone for two hours.
It's like a miniWatergate or something.
Hawkinsgate. Didn't those guys get caught?
Holy shit.
You found it?
Yeah, and not just Chrissy's file. Fred was seeing Ms. Kelley too.
So, if Sinclair's right, the freak is hiding here.
We move through the woods here together,
then Patrick and Andy, you split up.
Go around this way.
Me and Sinclair, we keep going,
then flank his ass from both sides.
That freak won't know what hit him.
Sorry about all the theatrics.
I… I didn't mean to scare you.
But you got yourself into quite the little predicament, didn't you?
You know, I relocated you guys to Lenora because I thought, you know,
"""Safe town, small, dull, far from Hawkins."""
"""Nothing could happen here."""
And what was it, a roller skate or something?
Ready to order some food?
I think so. Yeah. I'll just… uh…
Some more coffee and, um, I'll have a…
How about the club special?
Whatever you want, kiddo. It's on me.
[country music playing faintly in background]
Waffles, please.
Never too late in the day for breakfast, that's what I say.
Am I in trouble?
For the roller skate thing? No, no, no, no.
We'll make that go away. Don't even…
don't even worry about that.
That's not why you're here?
To be honest with you, kid, I…
I wish it was.
Last night, I saw something.
Something I've been dreading for some time.
I don't know how to say this other than just to say it.
Hawkins is in danger.
You have fought this evil before and you've won.
But this evil, it's like a virus.
Each time it returns, it comes back stronger,
smarter, deadlier.
A war is coming to Hawkins.
Where you at, freak?
You sure Eddie was here? Yeah. I… I'm… I'm positive.
Let's check around the back.
Around the back.
There are good people, brave friends,
who have helped you fight your battle in the past.
But they alone can't win this war,
not without you.
I know it's not fair to ask more of you,
but I wouldn't be here if I didn't think this was the only way,
if I didn't think you were the only one who might have a shot
to hit this thing so hard it can't get back up.
I don't have my powers.
What if I told you there was a way…
a way to bring them back?
I feared this moment would come, so I've been preparing,
developing the means to restore your abilities.
A program has the potential to not just bring them back,
but bring them back stronger than before.
But there are others who don't believe in you,
who think you are the cause.
I believe they're wrong.
I believe you're the cure.
That's why, if we're really gonna do this,
I'm gonna ask that you leave with me now.
"The reservation's under ""Byers."""
But you should know there is a very real possibility
this program fails.
And if it does, you will never see your friends again.
My friends in Hawkins, are they in danger?
I'm afraid your friends in Hawkins are very much…
Can I see Fred's file? Yeah.
…in the eye of the storm.
You may feel you need to go to them now,
but if you do,
you will risk everything,
risk everyone.
Max, I know something's wrong.
Max, what you've been through…
Billy!
…it's a lot for anyone.
And it's okay to not be okay.
Max? What is it?
Max! Max!
Max.
They're not the only ones in danger.
It's life as we know it.
This is why I'm here.
Because I believe you are our best hope.
Our only hope.
What if I'm not good?
What if I'm the monster?
I don't know you that well, kiddo,
but I'm betting the fate of the planet that you're one of the good ones.
But you've spent too much of your life
being told what to do by people like me.
I know that.
So, you say the word and I will take you back home.
Or…
come with me now.
Find out for yourself.
Max.
I'm sorry. I'm having trouble understanding any of this.
I mean, what exactly is going on in Hawkins? What's doing these killings?
That's what we're trying to ascertain. Where is El, like, right now?
For her safety, it's best you don't know. This is insane! This is insane!
So this training to get El's powers back, how long is it gonna take?
Could take weeks, could take months. Months?
Until then, agents Harmon and Wallace will stay with you.
We're not in danger.
Our friends live in Hawkins.
My family lives in Hawkins.
I'll work to contain the situation until Eleven is ready.
In the meantime, it is of vital importance you do not speak to anyone about this.
No. No way.
I know this is difficult to understand. It's not difficult. This is impossible.
There are factions within our government who are working directly against Eleven,
who are, in fact, searching for her as we speak.
We can't risk contact.
If they learned about any of this, it will jeopardize Eleven.
And if Eleven is jeopardized, so are your friends.
And so is your family.
So, what? We're just supposed to trust that you're the good guys?
Whoever you are?
We're friends of Owens.
Eleven trusted us.
Now we're asking the same from you.
For you.
It was here.
Right here.
A grandfather clock?
It was so real.
And then, when I got closer, suddenly I just…
Max, come on. Max?
…I woke up.
It was like she was in a trance or something.
Exactly what Eddie said happened to Chrissy.
That's not even the bad part.
Fred and Chrissy, they both came to Miss Kelley for help.
Uh, they both were having headaches,
bad headaches that wouldn't go away. And then…
then the nightmares.
Trouble sleeping.
They'd wake up in a cold sweat.
Then they started seeing things.
Bad things.
From their pasts.
These visions, they just…
they kept on getting worse and worse, until eventually…
everything ended.
Vecna's curse.
Chrissy's headache started a week ago.
Fred's, six days ago.
I've been having them for five days.
I don't know how long I have.
All I know is that,
for Fred and Chrissy,
they both died less than 24 hours after their first vision.
And I just saw that goddamn clock, so…
…looks like I'm gonna die tomorrow.
Stay here.
It's me! Lucas?
It's me. Jesus, what's wrong with you?
I'm sorry. I could've taken you out with this lamp!
Sorry, guys. Sorry.
I was… I was biking for eight miles.
Give me a second. Shit.
We've got a code red. What?
Dustin.
I've been with Jason, Patrick, and Andy, and they've gone totally off the rails.
They're trying to capture Eddie, and they think you know where he is.
You're in terrible danger.
All right. Yeah, that definitely sucks,
but we've got bigger problems than Jason now.
Would you get the door? I'm busy!
I said get the door.
This is unbelievable.
Hey there. Is, uh, is Lucas home?
Negative.
You know where he is?
Uh, we're just… We were supposed to go out and
Go out? I see he's taken a step down from Max.
I'm sorry.
Uh, well, you're the little sister who plays Dungeons & Dragons, huh?
What's it to you?
Do you know Dustin Henderson?
Know him? I've bled with him.
Chances are, he's with your cheater boyfriend.
Oh, if and when you do find Lucas,
please tell him I've been covering for his ass for two days now.
Each day of covering costs ten bucks, with a DPR.
That's a daily percentage rate of 7.9%.
Another week of this and he's buying me a goddamn Nintendo,
with Duck Hunt.
Where the hell's Sinclair?
That's what we're about to find out.
We've been tricked, boys.
Okay, be honest. Uh…
You guys understand any of this?
No. Pretty straightforward.
Oh, straightforward, really?
What's confusing to you?
So far, everyone Vecna has cursed has died,
except for this old Victor Creel dude Nancy found.
He's the only known survivor.
If anyone knows how to beat this curse, it's him.
That's assuming he was cursed, which we don't even know.
How can Vecna have existed in the '50s? It doesn't make sense.
Far as we know, Eleven didn't create the Upside Down.
She opened a gate to it.
The Upside Down has probably been around for thousands of years. Millions.
I wouldn't be surprised if it predated the dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs? What are we Okay.
But if a gate didn't exist in the '50s, how did Vecna get through?
How's he getting through now? And why now?
And why then? Just pops out in the '50s,
"kills one family, and he's like, ""I'm good."""
And poof, he just disappears. Just… gone?
Only to return 30 years later and start killing random teens?
No, I don't buy it.
Straightforward, my ass.
Honestly, Henderson, a little humility now and then, it wouldn't hurt you.
Sorry.
Any idea what she's writing?
Did she sleep?
I mean,
would you?
Okay, so…
…we have a plan.
Thanks to Nancy's minions,
we are now rockstar psychology students at the University of Notre Dame.
I'm now Ruth. And I'm Rose.
Ruth?
Nice GPA.
Thanks.
So we called Pennhurst Asylum, told them we'd like to speak with Creel
for a thesis we're cowriting on paranoid schizophrenics
To which they said no.
But we landed a three o'clock with the director.
Now all we have to do is charm him and convince him to let us talk to Victor.
Then maybe we can rid Max of this curse.
About that.
We've been doing our Victor Creel homework, and, uh…
…we got some questions.
Lots of questions.
So do we. Hopefully, Victor has the answers.
Wait… Wait… Wait a second. Uh…
Where's mine?
Nancy, you're outta your mind if you think I'm babysitting again.
First, they're not babies anymore. And Max is in real danger.
She needs people around her. I know. But why me?
Oh my God, you have a Tom Cruise poster.
You have a Tom Cruise poster.
That's old.
It's just…
Can you please not touch anything? I can't do anything here, Nance.
Maybe I can be helpful with this asylum director dude.
I don't know. I could turn on my… my charm.
Not the charm we need. Ouch.
No, I just…
I did a little digging last night, and it turns out this Dr. Hatch
is a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association
and a Harvard visiting scholar, okay?
This is a lifelong student of the world. If we're gonna win him over,
we're gonna have to convince him we are too.
That, like him…
…we are true academic scholars.
Holy shit. There's a little ballerina in here.
Academic scholar? She's giving you an academic scholar vibe? Yeah.
No, but…
…she will.
Oh, please, tell me you're joking.
It's busy. It's still busy.
Did I do something wrong? It says dial one, then the number, which
You can check on your kids later. I don't understand why it's still busy.
Joyce, there are certain things one can be late to in life.
A dentist's appointment.
A oneyearold's birthday party, because who cares?
Little idiot's not gonna remember it.
But for what is essentially a ransom exchange,
for that, for that, I think you very much need to be
on time.
I'm sorry. I'm very tense.
Clearly.
Head west, through forest. You will see a church with a gray roof.
Wait inside. Yuri will meet you there.
So you heard from her?
Yeah, they arrived last night.
They're meeting Yuri soon.
If all goes well, by tomorrow night you're home,
eating Enzo's with your sexy woman.
She's not my woman.
Of course not. She saves your life because of friendship.
Look, American,
do not put too much hope into this dream.
I have thought long about this,
and I give you odds of success
fifty to one.
You don't even seem nervous, American. I'm impressed.
You're a cool cat.
Like Steve McQueen. The Cooler King. Yeah?
Let's hope not.
Of course not, because Cooler King went back to cooler.
So, you must be better than McQueen today.
I change mind.
Now I give you odds
a hundred to one.
Our nosy friend again. Where do you want it?
Just not my face.
Of course not. Must be pretty for your woman.
She's not my woman.
Amazing you can get this many people and have it this quiet.
Keep in mind that…
Where are you going?
I'm just getting something to drink.
Is that allowed or… How does this house arrest work?
You're not under arrest.
Right.
No, no, you're… you're here to protect us.
And watch TV, apparently.
I… I mean, I don't think they've thought this through.
If this goes on for a month, or months, and people can't get a hold of us,
they're gonna totally freak out.
Meanwhile, my mom's probably having a panic attack.
And what about Hawkins?
"That lady's supposed to keep it ""contained."""
Like you can contain any of this without El. I mean…
Yeah.
If you keep staring at that, it's not gonna change. You know?
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Before the cops came,
me and El, we… we had a bad fight.
We never fight.
I mean, we fought before,
but just, like, silly fights, stupid fights.
But, I don't know, this one just felt more adult.
Like, it… it just felt more real.
Like, a fight you can't come back from.
Maybe I should've said something, and if I would've said that thing,
then maybe she'd want me there with her, wherever she is.
No. Look, Mike,
you're gonna see her again,
and whatever you didn't say, you can say it to her then.
Okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
She's gonna be okay.
She's not in Hawkins. That's what we should be worrying about.
You don't trust Owens?
No. I don't know.
I mean,
he's been good to us and good to El,
but he wasn't able to protect me.
That was you guys who saved me.
That was you guys.
Looks like it's gonna be up to us again.
It always is, isn't it?
Which is why we can't stay here.
Listen,
let's assume these friends of Owens are telling the truth.
We can't call Hawkins without alerting the military,
putting El in danger.
Fine. Then we'll just go to them.
Go to Hawkins? How?
What are you worried about? Ponch and Jon out there?
They're halfasleep now watching golf.
No, Jonathan. I mean, we don't have a car or money.
Then we'll hail ourselves a ride.
A cheap one.
Excuse me, sir?
Excuse me, sir?
What?
We're hungry.
I could eat.
Surf's up. Surfer Boy Pizza, this is Argyle speaking.
We make everything fresh here at Surfer Boy except for our pineapple,
which comes from a can.
But I still highly recommend slapping some juicy pineapple on your pie.
Oh, fruit on your pizza's gnarly, you say?
Well, I say try before you deny.
Hello?
I know you guys are staring at me. What, sorry?
You said you needed something? Just hanging out.
How you think your eyes boring into the back of my head
is protecting me from Vecna, I don't know.
You can look at me now. Thank you. Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry.
For you.
For you.
And, um, you.
Oh, and, um, give these to Mike, El, and Will.
If you can ever get a hold of them again.
What are you doing? No, don't. That's not for now. Don't open it now.
Don't… Okay.
I'm sorry. What is this?
It's, um…
it's a failsafe.
For after.
If things don't work out.
Wait, whoa. Max, things are gonna work out.
No!
No, I don't need you to reassure me and tell me it's all gonna work out.
People have been telling me that my entire life and it's almost never true.
It's never true.
I mean, of course this asshole curses me.
Should've seen that one coming.
If we go to East Hawkins, will this reach Pennhurst?
Of course. Yeah. Why are we talking about East Hawkins?
No. No. No!
Max, Max. Seriously.
Seriously, I'm not joking. I'm not driving you anywhere.
If you think I'm going to spend what is likely the last day of my life
in the armpit that is Mike Wheeler's basement,
you're out of your mind.
Either take me where I need to go or tie me down,
which is technically kidnapping of a minor.
And if I live to see another day, Steve, I swear to God, I will prosecute.
Open the door.
Uh, no.
I know a good lawyer.
Henderson, that super walkie of yours better reach Pennhurst.
I can't breathe in this thing, and I'm itchy. I'm itching all over.
It's not all about comfort.
Okay? We're academics.
Who are evidently coming straight from Easter brunch.
Also, this bra that you gave me is really pinching my boobs.
Okay. Could you just let me do the talking? If that's even possible?
It's not only possible, it's inevitable.
Because shortly, I'll be dead from strangulation.
3.9 GPAs.
Both of you.
Impressive.
And this is a recommendation from Professor Brantley.
Yeah, I know Larry. Quite well, actually.
Eh, you know what they say.
"""Those who can't do, teach."""
Uh, yes, yes, that's actually why we're here.
I mean, we can only learn so much in a classroom.
Mmm.
And I'm sympathetic to your struggle, truly.
But there is a protocol to visiting a patient like Victor.
You put in a request
and then undergo a screening process,
at which point the board will make a decision.
I can see you're disappointed.
But I'm more than happy to give you a tour.
Perhaps you can even speak to some patients in our lowsecurity wing.
And we'd… we would love that.
It's just that, um…
…our thesis is due next month.
And you're out of time.
Whose fault is that?
Ours. Absolutely.
And I do apologize
Don't apologize, Ruth. Screw that.
The fact is, we did put in a request months ago and were denied.
And then we reapplied and were denied again.
And coming here was our lastditch effort to save our thesis.
And I really… I can't breathe in this thing.
Well, Rose, maybe you'd like to go outside and get some air.
Maybe I should, Ruth. Mmhmm.
Because I'm starting to think this whole thing is a colossal mistake.
I'm breaking out in a rash.
My boobs hurt. And I'll tell you the truth, Anthony.
May I call you Anthony? These aren't my clothes.
I borrowed them because I wanted you to take us seriously.
Because nobody takes girls seriously in this field. They just don't.
We don't look the part or whatever. But can I tell you a story?
1978, I was at summer camp.
And my counselor Drew told me and everyone in Cabin C
the true story of the Victor Creel Massacre.
And little Petey McHew… You know Petey, right, Ruth?
Of… Of course.
Yeah. Little Petey McHew started sobbing right there on the spot.
Fullon hyperventilating.
The other campers couldn't sleep for weeks.
I couldn't either, but not 'cause I was scared.
Because I was obsessed with the question,
"""What would drive a human being to commit such unimaginable acts?"""
Other kids wanted to be astronauts, basketball players, rock stars.
But I wanted to be you.
I wanted to be you.
So, forgive me if I'll now try anything in my power,
including wearing this ridiculous outfit,
if I might get to speak to the man that ignited my passion
and learn a little more about how his twisted, but let's face it,
totally fascinating mind works.
So, yes, we don't have the official paperwork,
but don't tell me that crybaby Petey McHew
wouldn't have gotten an audience with Victor in moments
if he'd asked politely,
because you and I both know that he would.
So… ten minutes with Victor.
That's all I ask.
I'm back in 30.
Mmhmm.
If things go sideways, I should mention I'm now a black belt in karate.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello
Who are you?
I… Uh… We're looking for Yuri.
Why do you need to see Yuri?
It's actually, uh
It's a private matter. Is Yuri here?
I'm sorry.
I don't know how to tell you this,
but you're a day late.
What? You see damage to this hull?
Yuri was on sightseeing trip to see polar bears.
And then bears got into plane
and pull him out of cockpit and kill Yuri.
No. Yeah.
And he loved bears.
They broke his heart.
Or rather punctured it
with their bear claws.
I got you. I got you good.
I'm Yuri. I'm Yuri.
Oh. Oh.
Uh, you… you must be Joycey? Just Joyce.
And you are? Murray.
Murray? Yeah.
Yuri. Yuri, Murray, Yuri, Murray. We rhyme.
Yeah. I hear it.
Forty thousand American dollars, as promised.
I love the smell of cash in morning.
Right.
I hope you do not mind if I count.
You two seem very nice, very trustworthy people.
But so did my brother
before he stole my wife!
Poor bird, you're freezing.
Please, have some coffee. Still hot.
This could be a while
Why are you staring at me?
Huh? I am asking you!
Move, bastard!
Crazy American.
Hey! Get back! Get back!
Get back!
Broken…
Cannot work.
Cannot work.
Stay there.
Where is the American?!
Watch your back, American...
Where do you think you're going, American?
Stand.
Stand up!
Hands.
Hands!
Tool shed! It came from the tool shed!
Open up!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Keep pushing! Hurry!
RUN!
There!
There!
We can't let him get to the tree line!
A hundred to one.
Son of a bitch.

That thing's got batteries in it, right?
I'm not even answering that question.
Yes, it has batteries. Yeah, I got it.
Mom.
Hey, sweetie. I thought you were with your friends today.
Yeah, I… I was. I am.
Shouldn't you be at work?
Oh, Mr. Bradley let me off early. So I'm just catching up on some chores.
Um, I… I left some letters inside.
For you and… and Granny and Uncle Jack.
And Dad.
If you can find him.
Letters? I… I don't understand.
Uh,
I just… um…
With all the murders and everything, I…
I know it's stupid, but I just started to think,
"""What if something happens to me?"""
Max, baby, nothing is going to happen to you.
I know. But if… if it did, I just…
There's so many things that I want to say, that I need to say. And…
Promise you'll give the letters out? Max, you're scaring me.
I'm not trying to scare you. Is something going on?
No. Is it, baby?
No. No, you're right. I'm sure I'll be fine. I'm being silly.
Max. Oh, sweetie.
Shh.
It's okay.
Nothing is going to happen, baby.
I promise.
Nothing you don't deserve.
Mom, let go of me.
Mom? Let go.
Maxine.
You think some letters
are going to make things right?
You've broken everything.
Billy!
Your time
is almost at an end.
Let go!
Hey, that was longer than 20 seconds.
Hey, whoa, whoa. You all right?
I'm fine. Just drive.
Did something happen? Can we please just go?
These are our gardens.
Beautiful, aren't they?
We allow them two hours of outside time a day.
Can't they just escape?
They could.
But the vast majority choose to be here.
They like it here.
This is one of our more popular areas. The listening room.
We found that music has
a particularly calming effect on the broken mind.
The right song,
particularly one which holds some personal meaning,
can prove a salient stimulus.
But there are those who are
beyond a cure.
Uh, Dr. Hatch, do you think it might be possible for us
to speak to Victor alone?
Alone?
I… I think that we would just love the challenge of speaking with Victor
without the safety net of an expert such as yourself.
Then we could really rub it in Professor Bradley's face.
Professor Bradley? I don't believe I know a Professor Bradley.
Brantley.
She… she meant to say Brantley.
Didn't I say Brantley? What did I say?
Sorry, silly me. Words, letters.
Guess I'm just nervous. I mean, excited.
So excited to speak with Victor.
Preferably, as she said, alone?
Yes.
Why not?
You've caught me in a rebellious mood.
And there's something rather urgent I need to check on anyway, so…
Sure.
Keep a close eye on them.
Thank you so much, Dr. Hatch. Thank you.
Do not startle him.
Do not touch him.
Do not pass him anything.
Stand five feet away from the bars at all times.
Get away.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Victor.
Today's your lucky day!
You got visitors.
Real pretty ones.
Must be in one of his moods.
Have fun.
Victor?
My name is Nancy.
Nancy Wheeler.
And this is…
Robin Buckley.
Um, we have some questions.
I don't talk to reporters.
Hatch knows that.
We're not reporters.
We're here because… we believe you.
And because
we need your help.
Whatever killed your family,
we think it's back.

I'm kidding. I'm sure he's not dead.
But still, I should check.
I don't like him.
Antonov, phone for you.
You realize we just had an escape?
They say it's urgent.
Hello?
Enzo. It is Yuri.
Why are you calling me here? Are you mad?
I know. I am very sorry. I just felt you should know that there has been...
...a slight change in plans.
What? What has happened?
I just got off the phone
with your warden.
A very productive call.
It turns out, escaped prisoners are worth quite a bit of money.
So Yuri thinks, why not keep the forty grand and make extra money?
That wasn't the deal.
But it is a better deal for Yuri, yes?
And you know what is worth even more than escaped prisoner?
Corrupt guards.
What have you done?!
And worth most of all...

When he attacks, our friend described it as a trance.
Like a waking nightmare.
That's why we think he's coming for her next.
Does any of this, anything we've told you, sound like what happened to your family?
Victor.
I know this is hard You don't know anything!
You're right.
We don't know. That's why we're here.
To learn, to understand.
We need to know how you survived that night.
Survived?
Is that what you call this?
Did I survive?
No, I assure you,
I am still very much in hell.
[sinister music overlaid with jaunty big band music]
I had been back from the war some 14 years.
Her greatuncle had died, leaving us a small fortune.
Enough to buy a new home,
a new life.
What'd I tell ya? Wow.
This is amazing.
It looks like a fairy tale.
A dream.
Alice, no running.
It's so big!
This is nice.
Yeah.
It was a magnificent home. Yeah.
Alice said it looked like it was from a fairy tale.
Alice.
Was this your daughter?
Mmm. Yeah.
But Henry, my…
my boy,
he was a sensitive child…
…and I could see he felt something was wrong.
We had one month of peace in that house.
And then it began.
Dead animals,
mutilated, tortured,
began to appear near our home.
Rabbits, squirrels, chickens, even dogs.
The police chief blamed the attacks on a wildcat.
This… …this was no wildcat.
This was an evil.
And evil neither animal nor human.
This was
a spawn of Satan.
A demon.
And it was even closer than I realized.
Victor!
My family began to have encounters
conjured by this demon.
Nightmares.
Waking, living nightmares.
This demon, it seemed to take pleasure in tormenting us.
Even poor, innocent Alice.
Alice!
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. Come here.
It wasn't long before I began to have encounters of my own.
I suppose
all evil
must have a home.
And though I had not a rational explanation for it, I…
I could sense this demon,
always close.
I became convinced it was hiding,
nesting,
somewhere within the shadows of our home.
It had cursed our town.
It had cursed our home.
It had cursed us.

But I was back to France,
back in the war.
It… it was a memory.
I had thought German soldiers were inside.
I ordered its shelling.
I was wrong.
This demon,
it was taunting me.
And I was sure it would take me,
just as he'd taken my Virginia.
But then…
I heard…
…another voice.

At first, I believed it was an angel.
And I… I followed her,
only to find myself…
…in a nightmare far worse.
While I was away,
the demon took my children.
Henry slipped into a coma shortly after that.
A week later, he died.
I tried to join them.
I tried.
Hatch stopped the bleeding.
He wouldn't let me join them.
The angel you followed,
who was she?
Victor?
Victor.
Is he everything you hoped he would be?
I just had a very interesting conversation with Professor Brantley.
Perhaps we should discuss in my office
while we wait for the police.

And then, when we asked him about the angel, he started to hum.

Look, I think we can figure this out, okay?
We just gotta open our minds.
Open our minds? That's an open grave in front of me, man!
Open my mind? What are you talking about? Listen. Hey, dude! Hey!
Just relax, okay?
Yeah. Why don't you just go to the van…
…and do your thing, huh?
Purple Palm Tree Delight. Right.
Right.
It's all worn off.
It's just worn off.
I'm all emotional.
You're emotional. Okay.
I'm sorry. You're fine.
Jonathan. Yeah?
More weed? Is that really a good idea now?
Got a better idea to keep him calm?
Let's just get this done.
You can't let him get to you.
He's stoned out of his mind. Doesn't know what he's talking about.
That doesn't mean he's wrong.
I mean, if that guy would've lived one more second, one more second,
then w… we would know where she is.
Wh… Why didn't he just say the number?
I should've explained myself.
Maybe Eleven would've taken me with her and things would be different, but…
No. I didn't… I didn't know what to say.
Sometimes I think it's just scary to open up like that.
To say how you really feel.
Especially to people you care about the most.
Because, what if…
what if they don't like the truth?
Does anybody know the dead dude's name?
What? The dead dude.
I'm making him a headstone.
You do realize we spent all morning hiding the body.
"Well, I'll just write, uh, ""Here Lies Unknown Hero Agent Man."""
"Yeah. ""Saved Argyle, Jonathan, Will, and Mike from certain death."""
You… You're gonna write our names on the pizza box?
They're pretty common names.
Okay, dude. Uh, do your thing.
Jesus Christ.
Come on, man.
That's his pen.
What?
Unknown Hero Agent Man,
that's the pen he gave me right before he died.
Piece of shit.
Why would he give me a pen that didn't work?
Come on.
Hey, man, I'm using that.
What are you doing?
Something fell outta that pen, man.
Wh… What is it?
It's the number.
We've had it this whole time.
We got his digits, man?
Did I tell you it's okay to break?
Over there, there is a hand.
A HAND!
Are we animals?
Psst!
Hey, Ivan. Ivan!
Stop calling my name.
You trying to get me in trouble?
I don't know what they've told you,
but it is all lies.
I'm here by mistake!
I'm sorry. I cannot help you.
I can make you rich.
See this American?
He comes from money.
Old money.
Tell him, American. Tell him how you will make him rich.
You're a real help, American, you know that?
A real help.
Hey.
You want to die here? You want to die? Is that it?
That's what we've been brought here to do.
So, that is it? You give up, then?
What about your woman, huh?
She's captured, yes, but still alive.
We can still save her.
"""Save her."""
That is amusing to you?
You don't get it, do you? You don't get it.
The closer I get with Joyce, the more danger she's in.
You're not thinking straight, American.
No, I think I am.
For the first time in my life, I think I'm thinking straight.
I used to think I was cursed.
Ever since I was 18.
Got some letter of induction in the mail.
Uncle Sam wants me to go fight some war in the jungle.
Charlie's moving south like a plague 'cause of commie bastards like you, and…
You know, I'm happy enough to go.
Prove to my old man I'm not the piece of shit he thinks I am.
I get over there, I must test well, and they put me in the Chemical Corps.
There I am. I'm just… a kid, you know.
I'm 18 years old, 8,000 miles away,
and I'm mixing up these… 55gallon drums of Agent Orange.
With just these kitchen gloves, you know?
We used to clean out these buffalo turbines after a run
and just be inhaling the stuff.
No masks, nothing.
"""It's not chemical warfare. It's just herbicide to kill plants."""
"""Harmless."" That's what they told us."
Then I got back to real life,
and these guys I worked with, the ones that made it back,
they started trying to get back to normal, you know?
Having families. And then things started going wrong.
Kids born stillborn. Dead in the womb.
Crooked spines, eyes popped out.
The horror…
followed us, clung to us.
My wife Diane, she wanted a baby.
I did too.
We had a baby, and she was, um…
she was born healthy.
She was perfect, you know. Sara.
And then she died.
Blood pressure's dropping.
It wasn't an easy death. She…
suffered.
I knew the risks, but I, um…
I hid them.
And then Diane left me. She didn't blame me. Not with words.
After that, I was just…
I just hid myself in drugs and alcohol.
And then people started coming into my life.
This girl El, and Joyce just happened, and I told myself they needed me.
But that wasn't true.
That's a lie. They didn't need me.
I needed them.
I needed them.
You were right, what you said last night. I knew the risks,
breaking out of here, but I did it anyway.
The minute I sent for Joyce, the minute I sent for her,
I sentenced her to death.
Just like I did with Sara.
Everyone I love, I hurt.
See, I was wrong this whole time.
I wasn't cursed.
I am the curse.
I've heard rumors of a monster.
From America.
I don't know if what you say is true, American,
if you're truly a cursed man, but you're right about one thing.
We are going to die in here.
Can I help you?
We need to look around.
Yep.
I think it's some kind of leak.
I haven't had a chance to fix it with everything going on.
Pack your things. We're moving you.
The devil is here.
I can feel his presence…
growing stronger each day.
But I know Chrissy's in heaven now,
looking down at us, smiling.
Happy to see all the lives she touched and brightened.
But I also know she's frustrated.
Angry.
That the monster that did this to her is still out there.
Still.
Hurting others.
How can he live, while my angel is gone?
I know God has a plan…
Lord, I've prayed.
And I just do not understand it.
I see no reason.
I see no reason.
So I finally got ahold of Cappelletti.
Photos for the '86 yearbook.
Hot damn.
Sinclair?
Goddamn traitor.
Only reason he'd lead us to a dead end.
The Hellfire Club.
They're hiding Eddie. Maybe we should bring this to the cops.
The cops who think Chrissy's a drug dealer?
Who are letting this… this psycho go around killing people?
I'm just saying, what if this cult is doing shit to us?
Doing what? They already know we're after them.
What if they cursed us or some shit? Patrick thinks he's cursed.
Hey!
None of this is funny.
Look, I don't believe in that supernatural crap, all right?
But this cult is dangerous.
We have to be smart about this.
I made a list.
Everywhere these freaks have been seen.
We divide and conquer. Check 'em out one by one. Smoke 'em out.
We should add Reefer Rick's house to this.
What?
Reefer Rick.
He's Eddie's supplier.
He's supposed to be in prison, but someone spotted him back in his house.
Now my parents are freaking out and shit.
It's probably nothing.
I don't know.
No, that's good. That's good.
No stones unturned.
Yeah, that's not creepy.
What exactly are we supposed to be looking for in this shithole?
We're not sure.
We just know this house is important to Vecna.
Because Max saw it in Vecna's red soup mind world?
Basically. Great.
Maybe it holds a clue to where Vecna is. Why he's back. Why he killed the Creels.
And how to stop him before he comes back for Max.
We don't think he's in here,
do we?
Guess we'll find out.
Ready?
Mmhmm.
Max.
What are you doing in here,
Max?
It's locked.
Should I knock, see if anybody's home?
No need.
I found a key.
Looks like someone forgot to pay their electric bill.
Where'd everyone get those?
Do you need to be told everything?
You're not a child.
Thank you. Huh.
Back pocket.
They just left everything.
I guess a triple homicide isn't good for resale value.
Hey, guys?
You all see that, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
Is this what you saw?
In your visions?
I mean, it's… just a clock.
Right?
Like a normal old clock.
Why is this wizard obsessed with clocks?
Maybe he's, like, a clockmaker or something?
I think you cracked the case, Steve.
All I know is
the answers are here.
Somewhere.
Okay, everyone stay in groups of two. Robin, upstairs.
Come on. Let's go.
Was that a sigh? No, I did not sigh.
Why'd you sigh? I didn't sigh. Just come on, dude.
I heard you. W… We're just always partners, okay?
You have a problem with that?
It'd just be nice to, I don't know, mix it up a bit.
I'm boring you? Is that it? No, the opposite…
Ah.
Hey, Yuri.
Yuri, I need to take a piss here.
Just give it up. He can't hear you.
I really do have to go, Joyce.
This isn't some ploy to escape.
He can't hear. What?
Joyce, what are you doing?
Joyce! Joyce!
Joyce! My leg is too short.
Can you grab that shard with your foot?
Perhaps, you know, we should talk this through first.
What is there to talk through?
We cut our binds, break free.
Yes, okay. Then what?
Then you take him out. Take him out?
You know karate. You said you were a black belt.
We're 10,000 feet in the air, Joyce.
I take him, who flies this plane?
All right, so don't knock him out.
Just get his gun and make him turn us around.
Get his gun. Just like that, huh?
Is black not the highest color? Yes.
It's just… Just what?
I've never fought in a realworld scenario, okay?
I've only sparred with the other students.
How old?
It doesn't go younger than 13.
Thirteen?
But Jeremiah is 16.
Almost. His birthday is next month.
And… And Jeremiah is a ferocious fighter.
Lightning fast. Very skilled.
And I beat him.
That one time.
And certainly Yuri is not trained or skilled like Jeremiah.
So, yes.
Yes, you're right.
I can defeat Yuri.
Absolutely.
Thank you for talking it through. I feel much better now.
Yeah.
No.
Well, well.
Look who finally decided to join us.
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.
Stop this!
Let me out!
In 1786,
Nicolas Dalayrac wrote an opera called Nina.
"[""Quand le bienaimé reviendra"" by Dalayrac playing]"
Papa.
It's the story about a young woman whose lover was killed in a duel.
Nina was so traumatized that she buried the memory.
It was as if it never happened.
Every day, she would return to the train station
to await her lover's return.
A return that would never be.
If only Nina could know the truth.
This… This isn't real.
No.
But it once was.
A memory.
Very good.
How?
Never mind how.
Let me out.
I want out!
I'm sorry, Eleven.
You'll have to find your own way out.
Leave your train station.
Stop waiting.
Focus.
Listen.
Remember.
I don't understand.
I don't understand!
Well, well.
Look who finally decided to join us.
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.
Focus.
Listen.
Remember.
Well, well.
Look who finally decided to join us.
Someone's a sleepyhead this morning.
I'm sorry. Am I… in trouble?
Trouble?
No.
No, why do you think that?
You're just missing out on all the fun.
Training starts any minute.
Okay.
Hey.
There's nothing to be nervous about.
You're going to do great today.
I just know it.
Good morning, children. Good morning, Papa.
How are we feeling today?
Good, Papa.
Good.
Number Twelve.
Would you be so kind and open the door?
Yes, Papa.
Please, follow me.
How's she doing? Very well.
She's swimming now.
Good. 'Cause I just got off the phone with Stinson.
We don't have much time.
Well then, she'll just have to swim faster.
There's one. Argyle, slow down. There's one what?
Slow down. Stop barking orders.
Argyle! Slow down!
Whoa! Christ!
Is it ringing?
No, it's just making a bunch of weird noises.
Busy?
Listen to this.
That remind you of anything?
WarGames.
What?
Oh my God, we're not calling a phone.
We're calling a computer.
I don't know if Nina's a computer like Joshua or Owens' lab,
but Unknown Hero Agent Man gave us access to it for a reason.
We just need to find the computer. We find Owens, then warn him.
Then we warn Eleven.
I just need a hacker.
The only hacker that I know lives…
in Utah.
Wait, Utah? Salt Lake City, to be specific.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
"What? Why ""Oh my God""?"
♪ Turn around ♪

NeverEnding Story. That scared the shit out of me.
The Nothing, man? That's some proper existential shit, dude.
You can't be serious.
If we take the I15 north, we'll get there by morning.
Oh, you're serious.
I know it sounds insane, but Suzie saved the world last year.
Maybe she can save it again.
Shit. Shit.
Looks like Rick's had company.
It's him.
Hey, Dustin.
You there?
It's Eddie. You remember me, right?
Hey, if anyone's there, I really think I might be in a bit of trouble here.
Okay? Wheeler?
Anybody?!
Hey, uh, Henderson?
Yeah?
Could you maybe, uh,
clarify what sort of clues we're supposed to be looking for here?
"""The world is full of obvious things"
"which nobody by any chance ever observes."""
Sherlock Holmes.
That's great.
Thanks. That's great.
Really helpful.
Sherlock…
Whoa, whoa.
What's wrong? There was a spider.
What? It's a black widow.
Okay. Don't go in there.
Oh, oh.
Wait, just… What?
Something? Shit. Okay. Wait. Stop moving.
Stop. I just… I got it. I got it. Thank you.
If there's a spider, you're never gonna find it
till it lays eggs and the babies spill out.
What's wrong with you?
Robin, seriously.
She's got problems.
Tell me about it. It's cool you two are friends now.
Maybe after we find Vecna, kill him, save the world and stuff,
maybe we can all go out.
You know? Me, you, Robin, Jonathan, when he's back.
It's not like we're dating. Me and Robin. Not like we're dating.
She told you? That we're not? Yes. She made that very clear.
Platonic with a capital P.
Yep. Thank you.
I mean…
I would date her. It's just…
She's… We're just… Never mind. We're friends.
Just friends. Right. Right.
Okay. All better.
Great. Thanks.
Well…
Great. Um…
Guess we should, uh, get back to the investigation.
"""The obvious things are not what people observe."""
"Or… ""Do… Don't observe."""
Or…
Sherlock Holmes.
What?
"[""Running Up That Hill"" playing faintly over headphones]"
I wish we had a longer loop.
Fortysix minutes isn't bad.
I think there are bigger concerns.
Like…
What if, by listening to this over and over, I get sick of it,
and suddenly it's not my favorite anymore?
Will it still work? Or will Kate Bush, like, lose her magic power or something?
Kate Bush? Never.
You're a Kate Bush fan?
Uh, yeah. Now I am.
Really? Yeah, megafan.
She… She saved your life.
Besides, we're hot on this creep's trail. We're gonna find Vecna
and kill him before he even thinks about messing with you again. All right?
In fact, I bet if we hit these suckers in the right combo,
we might just open a door to his secret lair.
Voilà.
You're such a dork.
I thought you were, like, one of the cool kids now.
I'm not cool?
I've really missed that.
Missed what?
Your laugh.
All done.
Work your magic, Kate.

I promise I'm gonna stop asking this, but…

Yeah.

Stop.
Very good, Two.
Very good.
Now,
which brave soul
would like to follow that?
Hmm?
Hmm? Me. Me. Me.
Me. Me. Me. Me. Me. Me.
Eleven?
Remember to stay focused.
Find the energy.
Feel it.
Why does he waste so much time with her?
Hey.
Quiet.
They're laughing.
At you.
They think you're weak.
Show them, Eleven.
Show them.
Good.
Now make it move.
Waste of time.
What is happening? She's going into arrest.
Okay, that's enough. Pull her out.
Pull her out!
Naughty, naughty bird.
Did you fall out of your nest?
Where do you think you are going?
Come on.
Be a good girl now and get back to your place.
Or what? Are you gonna shoot me?
I… I don't think the KGB would like that.
You're right, I cannot kill you.
But KGB didn't specify condition you must arrive in.
You are fragile cargo.
You can still break.
Not if I break you first.
My fingers are like arrows.
My arms, like iron.
My feet, like spears.
Resist,
and I will end you.
But turn this plane around,
and I will spare your life.
Kiai!
Ah! Kiai!
Let him go!
Let him go!
My fingers are like arrows.
My arms, like iron!
My feet, like spears!
Kiai!
Kiai!
What did you do?
What?
"I said, ""Don't knock him out."""
I thought you didn't know how to fly! I don't!
Pull up! Pull up!
I am pulling up!
It's like the Christmas lights.
The Christmas lights?
Yeah, when Will was in the Upside Down,
the lights… came to life.
Vecna's here.
In this house.
Just on the other side.
I think he just left the room.
Did he hear us?
Can he see us?
Headphones.
Wait, wait.
Everyone, turn off your flashlights and spread out.
We're not gonna be able to see if we turn off our flash… lights.
Jesus Christ.
I got him!
Got him!
I got him.
I… I had him.
Oh, whoa.
Oh, I think he's moving. He's moving. He's moving.
Shit.
I lost him.
No, you didn't.
It's an attic. Of course it's an attic.
Hold up, guys. What if he's leading us into a trap?
Guys, guys.
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Dude, he's not here, seriously.
Shut up and keep looking.
Dustin?
Please. Are… Are you there?
Never mind.
Come with me.
Holy shit.
Hey, freak!
Where do you think you're going? Shit.
Come on!
Just come on… You scared of some water? Let's go!
…you piece of shit!
Come on. Gotta help me out here, man.
Come on.
Come on, you piece of shit!
Come on!
Goddamn it!
Nope? Okay. All right. Okay.
Shit. Shit.
Flashlights.
Okay, what's happening?
Hey, stay back, man! Stay back!
Stay back!
Come on. We almost have him.
Hey, Patrick.
Patrick!
Patrick!
Patrick.
Hey, Patrick.
Hey, Patrick.
Patrick!
Air.
Get her some air, for Christ's sake.
It's okay. It will take time to adjust.
But you're safe now, hmm?
Giving us quite the workout. You really wanna do this again?
No! No! No!
Remarkable.
Stay away.
I said, stay away!
You didn't think it would be that easy,
did you?
I don't understand.
I do.
Papa?
Daughter.
"[""Quand le bienaimé reviendra"" by Dalayrac playing]"
Where is he?
Where was Eddie when that happened?
Wha…
Wait, what?
Eddie.
Where was Eddie when you saw this?
He… He was in the…
…in the boat, like I said.
Right.
Right. Right.
But then, uh…
…who lifted Patrick out the water?
What…
You're not listening to me.
Why aren't you listening to me? Jason, we are listening.
No, you're not. You're not.
Eddie, he's…
Eddie is a vessel.
Just a vessel.
A vessel?
For Satan.
He's made a pact with the devil. Now he has his powers.
You don't believe me.
We're just, uh,
processing all of this, that's all. Okay?
Yeah.
How do you expect to stop the devil if you don't believe he's real?
I can make it stop.
I can make the pain end.
Where's the girl?
I told you.
I don't…
I don't… I don't know.
There are two proposed explanations for what is happening.
Explanation one,
an invisible boogeyman from another dimension
is slaughtering these kids.
Explanation two,
Dr. Brenner's special little pet has gone rogue again
and he and his lackeys
are now seeking to cover it up.
Perhaps in the hopes of selling their pet to the Soviets.
Now,
which explanation sounds plausible to you?
Hmm?
I don't know.
There's still a chance to redeem yourself, Mr. Wallace.
Where is she?
No!
No! No!
No!
Do you know what happens when someone has a stroke?
The blood supply to the brain is cut off.
It scrambles the signals in the brain to the point where the mind
can forget how to do things.
To eat. To speak.
To walk.
When you were attacked last year,
I believe that your signals were scrambled in much the same way.
But just as a stroke victim can learn to walk again,
I believe you, too, can return to your full power.
Your abilities are still in here.
You just need to remember.
Everything that took place in my lab
was captured on videotape.
Every success and every failure.
It's important for you to not just see your past,
but to fully reexperience it.
In doing so, I believe we can
repair your broken signals.
As we saw tonight, that process has already begun.
If this all happened,
why don't I remember?
Because you do not want to.
Our brains have a defense mechanism in place
to protect it from bad memories.
From trauma.
You buried these memories long ago.
Papa.
When I was in there,
I saw something.
There was blood.
So much blood.
That was another memory,
a… a more powerful one,
invading from your subconscious.
You have demons, Eleven.
You have demons in your past.
That is why we must proceed carefully.
One step at a time,
one memory at a time.
If we go too fast,
I'm afraid you could become lost in the darkness.
And if you are lost…
so are we all.
Oh.
Hey, Eric. I'm taking five.
You just took five.
Yeah, well, tell Milo to take it easy on the onions next time.
Not to be a wimp, but can I sit in the car?
'Cause this is gonna totally and royally suck.
It'll be fine.
I can't stand to see those dull eyes of Eddie's break again.
I really, really can't.
At least he can drink himself into feeling better.
That's what my mom does.
Why don't we give it a trial?
"""Hey, Eddie. Uh, good news first this time."""
"""We got you some Dustinapproved junk food and that sixpack you requested."""
"""Oh yeah, and we found Vecna."""
"""Bad news is that he's in that other, darker, much scarier dimension,"
"and the gate's closed, so we have no way of getting to him."""
"""He's entirely shut off to us, so basically you're screwed."""
"""And, no, I know you were already screwed,"
"but now you're doubly, triply screwed."""
Wait. Maybe we don't put it like that.
"""We're one step closer to finding Vecna."""
That's what we say. That's what's important.
See, Robin? Positive spin can make all the difference.
Uhhuh.
Oh shit.
Nothing to see.
Just step back a little.
All right?
This way. As many of you know,
the Roane County line received a call
a little after midnight…
…reporting a homicide here on the lake.
Officer Callahan here and myself
arrived first on the scene.
We made our way to the shore of Lover's Lake,
about ten yards from that house you see behind me.
It was there that we found the victim,
an 18yearold senior from Hawkins High,
Patrick McKinney.
His limbs…
Oh my God. …his body, it was disfigured…
What are we even doing? I mean, where is the FBI?
There was an eyewitness on the scene… That's what I want to know.
We got a serial killer on the loose.
We have also identified a person of interest.
Eddie Munson.
We encourage anyone with information
to please come forward. Oh man.
This is not good. Really not good.
You've got a lot of questions, and I'm going to answer as many as I can.
Two o'clock at town hall,
where anyone from the Hawkins community is welcome. But right now,
I've got work to do, and I appreciate your understanding.
Is Eddie still in Hawkins?
Dustin, can you hear me? Wheeler?
Eddie. Holy shit.
Are you okay?
Nah, man. Pretty… Pretty goddamn far from okay.
Where is he? Where are you?
Skull Rock. Do you know it? Uh, yeah.
That's near Cornwallis and Garrett, yeah. I know where that is.
Hold tight. We're coming. We're coming.
I can't feel my butt.
Can't feel my butt.
Can you guys feel your butts?
I can feel my butt.
Everyone needs to be on their best behavior, okay?
Why are you looking at me when you say that?
I didn't. They're just really religious.
Yeah, and I'm super spiritual, dude.
Yeah, I think they're spiritual too. Just in a different way.
Oh. Hey.
Is Suzie here?
Ow!
Away, you starveling!
You elfskin! You dried neat's tongue!
This is my kind of party.
I've been bitten.
Help! Help!
Beautiful performance. Excuse me.
Uh, hey, we're looking for Suzie.
Can you not see
that we are filming?
Come on.
All right, stay in it, Tabitha. Stay in it.
Hi, we're looking for Suzie.
Don't know, don't care.
That's too much salt, Peter. Father's kidneys! Father's kidneys!
Cornelius!
How many times do I have to tell you?
That is not a toy.
Come on.
You make another escape,
I'm getting Father.
Who the hell are you?
Argyle.
Uh, and you are?
Eden.
Like the garden. Wow.
We're looking for Suzie. Do you know where she is?
Third floor, second door on your left.
You make sure to give that selfish foureyed shit a nice little shove for me.
Absolutely.
Eden, I…
I will shove her for you. I will…
I will do anything for you.
Well, great, she's not here.
"""Give her a shove."""
Suzie! Yeah?
Who the heck are you?
And what are you doing in my room?
Sorry, that's… that's fair. No, listen.
We're Dustin's friends. Yeah.
We really need your help.
You said an hour.
I underestimated.
I thought you were dead.
Might as well be.
We are truly in hell if hell froze over.
There's nothing south, but two miles north I saw some smoke.
Could be a town, a house.
Maybe somebody there knows where we can find this prison.
The topsecret prison.
Really?
Right.
Any luck with our friend?
What do you think?
Hey!
Dipshit!
We're outta here. Last chance.
Where's the prison?
I told you.
Yuri will help you for the right price.
I told you, we're wasting our time.
Half. What?
What? You heard me, you stubborn bastard.
Half the reward.
Twenty thousand.
Thirty thousand. Twentytwo.
Twentyfive.
All right.
Looks like we got ourselves
a moron!
You thought I was serious?
He thought I was serious.
I got you! I got you good!
There's only one thing you get if you take this deal.
You get to live.
You are not killer.
Oh, you're right.
He's not a killer.
No.
Thing is, we don't need to kill you.
We can just leave you here.
Because there's nothing for miles
and no one will find you.
No human, at least.
I saw tracks. Tracks.
In the woods, Yuri.
Bears. Bears.
Who knew you could see your own future?
Shall we fly out of here, little bird?
Uh, da, da.
Byebye, Yuri.
Wait.
You should go east, not north.
My warehouse is there. Supplies, guns, truck.
We will need to reach prison by nightfall
if you hope to save your friend.
That is, if he's not already dead.
Out.
Everyone out.
Let's go! Move it!
This is it, American.
I hope you're ready.
What are you all waiting for?
Move!
Let's go!
Move!
Am I dreaming, American?
Or is this real?
What is wrong with your American friend?
He has lost his spirit to live.
And he is not my friend.
Isn't that right, Cursed One?
You have lost your spirit to live.
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.
No…
He is American after all.
Big talk, but weak inside.
Tell him to eat.
Or he endangers us all.
We have a big fight ahead of us.
What are you talking about? Fight?
I have been in this place one week.
My first night,
I saw six men enter this room.
Six.
Just like us.
They came out
happy and fat, faces smothered in grease.
But when night fell, they were thrown into that pit out there.
But not alone.
You heard those roars, yes?
That is a monster.
Not from this world.
Thirty seconds it took! Thirty seconds...
And all six men…
You speak no sense.
If they plan to kill us tonight, why waste this food on us?
They want us strong.
So we can fight it.
To test its strength.
To train this monster for war.
But last week, the men got their weapons...
then scattered like fools.
We stick together...
Perhaps we stand a chance!
Perhaps we live to see another day.
Till tomorrow!
Let me guess.
This…
…it's about nine feet tall?
Thin, white skin?
No face?
No eyes?
Come on, come on, come on. Translate!
How do you know this?
'Cause I've seen one.
And I've fought one.
And all your theories about it,
they're all wrong.
You know why they feed captive predators live prey?
Because if they don't, the predator gets bored and it stops eating.
It needs the thrill of the hunt.
We're not here to train this monster with swords and axes.
We're here to entertain it.
And this food…
this food isn't to make us strong.
It's to, uh, make us plump.
So we're full of the nutrients and protein that a growing monster might need.
So eat up, boys.
Enjoy.
This is your last meal.
Which number are you aiming for?
Three.
You know,
sometimes
it's helpful to take a step away for a moment.
Let the mind clear.
Determined, aren't we?
You know…
…you remind me of someone. Someone I used to know really well.
Can you guess who that is?
One?
Papa said that he doesn't Exist? I know.
But can I tell you a secret?
Sometimes,
Papa doesn't tell the truth.
I spent years with One.
Right here.
In this very room.
Where is he?
Maybe we'll save that story for another day.
It doesn't have a happy ending, I'm afraid.
But he was a lot like you.
Everything was hard for him.
Then, out of nowhere, he walked in here and it was like
something had changed.
And I asked him what's different, and he said…
he said he had figured it out.
He had found his strength in a memory from his past.
Something that made him sad.
But also angry.
Do you
maybe have a memory like that?
Do you remember the day a strange woman came to see you?
This would've been when Eight was still here.
The woman,
she was calling a name to you.
Jane. No! No!
No! Jane!
That
was your mother.
Mama is dead.
She died making me.
And who told you that?
Papa.
Who doesn't always tell the truth.
This place…
and the people here…
are not what you think.
Good morning, children. Good morning, Papa.
I've got something very special planned for you today.
Are you ready?
Yes, Papa.
Good.
Seventeen, would you open the door?
Yes, Papa. Off you go.
After you.
We should've just told her the truth.
And risk everything?
No.
She'll find out soon enough.
Dude, I'm telling you, you're taking us the wrong way.
It's north. I'm positive. I checked the map.
You do realize Skull Rock, it's a super popular makeout spot?
Yeah. So?
Yeah, well, it wasn't popular until I made it popular.
All right? I practically invented it.
We're heading in the wrong direction. Steve.
Where are you going? Steve! Stop whining. Let's go. Trust me.
Okay, so apparently we're going this way now?
I swear to God, if they get us lost…
Hey.
You okay?
Uh, yeah.
I'm fine. Just…
thinking about Patrick. You know?
Yeah.
I mean, it's… it's like,
why him?
But then, I remember this one day,
he… he came to practice with a black eye.
He said he fell, but clearly he was lying.
It's like everyone Vecna targets
has something in their life.
Something that's Hurting them.
Haunting them.
Yeah.
I… I didn't really know Patrick,
so it was easy to just
look the other way, I guess.
But I did know you.
And I'm sorry I wasn't there.
It's not your fault.
No. I disappeared.
No, no, you didn't.
I just didn't look hard enough.
Okay?
But I see you now.
I see you.
Oh my God, they're so adorable. I just wanna squeeze 'em, you know?
If I'm permitted to see a silver lining in this endoftheworld doom and gloom,
it would be the rekindling of old flames that never should've been snuffed out.
I didn't mean that as a hint or anything.
Right.
But if I did mean it as a hint, would that be so terrible?
To wish for happiness for my friends?
You think I'm not happy?
I… I'm sure you are.
It's just, the other day, I mentioned Jonathan
and you flinched or winced or something like
I didn't flinch or wince.
Okay. Jonathan and I are fine.
Got it. We're good.
Right.
It's just…
He was supposed to be here for the break,
and then he backed out at the last minute for some vague, mumbly Jonathan reason.
And, to be honest, I'm not that surprised
because I've been feeling him pulling away.
And I don't know if it's because we're 2,000 miles away
or if he met someone new or what.
And now I can't find out why
because apparently he's blown up his family's house phone or something.
So, yeah, if… if the mention of his name caused a slight muscle spasm on my face,
that's… probably why.
Seems like a perfectly reasonable reason to flinch, wince, or something.
"You said, ""the happiness of your friends."""
So does that make us friends?
As in, officially?
Uh, yeah. I… I mean, right?
Right.
Oh, boom!
Bada bing, bada boom. There she is, Henderson.
Skull Rock.
In your face, man. In your stupid, cocky little face.
Doesn't make sense.
Yeah, yeah. Even with it staring you in the face, you can't admit it.
Can't admit you're wrong, you butthead.
I concur.
You, Dustin Henderson, are a…
total butthead.
Jesus, we thought you were a goner.
Yeah, me too, man.
Me too.
How long have you known Eddie was killing these kids?
It was his trailer where Chrissy was killed,
and you expect us to believe he was made a suspect just this morning?
The truth is we've been following several leads,
and, yes, Eddie Munson was one of them.
And we are now doing everything in our power to find him.
In the meantime, for your safety,
we will be enforcing a strict curfew.
What? That's your solution?
Hide from him? We're already doing that.
It's been days. Days!
So you tell me why he's not behind bars right now.
I understand you all are upset, but I promise you,
we will find him.
No.
You won't.
Jason?
Son, how about we talk about this in private?
Why? So you can keep me quiet?
So you can keep the truth from coming out?
I don't know about the rest of you,
but I can't bear to listen to any more excuses and lies.
That's enough. I agree, I've had enough!
In fact, I think we've all had enough.
Last night…
Last night, I saw things, things I can't explain.
Things the police don't wanna believe.
And things that I don't wanna believe myself.
But I know what I saw. I know.
And I've come to accept an awful truth.
These murders are ritualistic sacrifices.
We've all heard how satanic cults are spreading through our country
like some… some disease.
And Eddie Munson
is the leader of one of these cults.
A cult that operates here in Hawkins.
The mall fire.
All those unexplained deaths over the years.
Some people say our town is cursed. They just don't know why.
Now… Now we do.
Now we know.
They call themselves Hellfire.
That's bullshit!
The Hellfire isn't a cult. It's a club for nerds.
Erica! Just the facts.
A club.
A club. A harmless club. That's what they want you to think.
But it's a lie.
A lie designed to conceal the truth.
And now this cult is protecting its leader, Eddie.
Hiding him.
Allowing him to… to continue his rampage.
Last night, I became overcome with this feeling of… of hopelessness.
Then I remembered Romans 12:21.
"""Do not be overcome by evil."""
"""But overcome evil with good."""
And God knows there's good in this town.
So much good. It's in this room!
It's in this room, right here, right now.
So I came here today, humbly,
to ask for your help.
To join me in this fight.
Let us cast out this evil and save Hawkins together.
What are y'all just sitting around for?
You heard the kid.
Hey.
I want you all to hear me loud and clear on this.
Anyone interfering with this investigation
will be arrested.
Hey! Hey! We will be implementing a curfew.
If you are not in your house after sunset with the doors locked,
you'll be written up.
And it's gonna go on your permanent record.
Okay, that is a lot to process.
I mean, that might be seriously the craziest thing I've ever heard.
I know, it's hard to believe.
But it's true. All true.
I dial in to this computer and find a location,
and at this location is the Nina Project?
Exactly.
And the Nina Project is the code name for a video game?
No, it's not just a video game. It's a video game console.
It's basically America's answer to Nintendo.
Americantendo.
That's a stupid name.
You're right, it is a stupid name, but, Suzie, it's 16bit.
Sixteenbit?
Why have I never heard of it? Because it's top secret.
That's why we're doing this. Yeah, right. It's for the promotion.
The first people to find the secret location receive a
Americantendo? Uh, an Americantendo.
So you drove 3,000 miles over your spring break
so I can help you get a new video game console
no one has ever heard of?
Yes.
But it's not for us. It's for Dustin. Right.
Exactly. It's for Dustin. For Dustin's birthday, which is…
In two months, three days, five hours.
I don't know what you're doing,
but I am not spending my entire day babysitting.
Pull your damn weight. Language!
Oh no, am I gonna burn in hell now?
You tell her, Eden.
Out of my room. Don't touch me, you little shit!
Okay, so can you help?
I would do anything for Dustybun,
but I'm afraid there's been an unfortunate development.
After changing Dusty's grade, I was wracked with the most awful guilt.
Suzie, I am incredibly disappointed.
Father could see my soul was tortured, and he wrenched a confession out of me.
I wanted to help him.
Not only was I breaking the law, I was dating an agnostic.
An agnostic!
I've never seen Father so angry. …starting today.
He needed me.
Naturally… Father, no!
…after learning the terrible truth,
he confiscated my computer.
And Father is not one to change his mind.
I'm as likely to see it again as I am my poor Dustybun.
Where is it?
His study.
He uses it for work now.
And Father's always working, and his door is, like, permanently locked.
I'm really sorry.
Truly.
But it looks like you came all the way here for nothing.
Cornelius!
Unless…
Unless?
There might be a way.
But we're gonna need help.
And I mean a lot of help.
All right.
Guys?
Are you down here?
Guys?
They should've been back by now.
They should be back.
What time was the movie? Uh, four hours ago.
Hate to break it to you, Mrs. Wheeler, but they lied to you.
♪ Liar, liar, pants on fire ♪ Holly.
We don't think they're actually involved with Eddie, do we?
I think at this point, anything's possible.
Our children are not murderers, Ted. Don't put words in my mouth.
See, she does that, twists my words.
You're calling the theater?
The police.
When I got to the shore, I tried calling you guys, but, uh…
my walkie was busted, man.
Drenched.
So, uh, I did the thing that I do now, apparently.
I ran.
Do you know what time this was? The attack?
Yeah, no, I… I know exactly what time it was.
My walkie wasn't the only thing that got soaked.
Same time our flashlights went kablooey.
Which means what, exactly?
That that surge of energy was Vecna attacking Patrick.
Well, we're one step closer.
We know how Vecna attacks.
And where he attacks from.
So now we just need to sneak into his lair in the Upside Down
and drive a stake through his heart.
If he has a heart.
A stake? Is he like a vamp? Is he a vampire?
It was a metaphor. A bullet should work on him, right?
I say we chop his head off.
All of the above, but we can't do any of that
'til we find a way into the Upside Down. We need El to get her powers back.
Everything was way easier. We had this girl. She had superpowers.
Superpowers. Yeah, you mentioned her.
Hey, uh, Henderson's not, uh, cursed, is he?
Cursed? No, no. He's fine.
Mental? Absolutely.
Boom!
Bada… bada… boom.
I was right.
Skull Rock was north.
Seriously? You're serious? Mmhmm.
This is Skull Rock. Okay? Mmhmm.
You're totally, absolutely, 100% wrong. Right now.
Yes.
And no.
Oh my God.
This worked correctly when we left the Wheelers'.
Correct when we got in the car on Curly.
But it started to slip the further east we went.
Now it's way off.
When I was leading us here, I wasn't wrong.
The compass was.
So you're using faulty equipment. You're still wrong.
Except it isn't faulty.
Lucas, remember what can affect a compass?
An electromagnetic field. Yep.
Sorry. I must've skipped that class.
In the presence of a stronger electromagnetic field,
the needle will deflect towards that power.
So either there's some super big magnet around here, or…
There's a gate.
But we're nowhere near the lab.
But what if, somehow, there's another gate?
A gate that we don't know about.
It'd have to be smaller. Way less powerful.
Snacksize gate. How? Why?
No idea. All I know is that something is causing this disturbance,
and the last time we've seen anything like it, it was a gate.
And I hope it is because then we'd have a way to Vecna.
And a shot at freeing Max from this curse.
Where are you going? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Eddie's still a wanted man. We can't just go hike in the woods.
This little steel capsule might be the key to saving both Max and Eddie.
What say you, Eddie the Banished?
I say you're asking me to follow you into Mordor,
which, if I'm totally straight with you,
I think is a really bad idea.
But, uh, the Shire…
the Shire is burning.
So Mordor it is.
What is Mordor?
Get your stuff, dude. Let's go.
Today,
we are going to play a game.
The rules of the game are quite simple.
Stay in your circle.
If you leave your circle,
you lose.
The last person standing in their circle
will get to spend an extra hour of free time
in the rainbow room.
Now, even though we are going to be competing against one another…
Two.
Six.
…I don't want you to approach this any differently than one of our tests.
Yeah?
Now, this is very important.
If you allow anger or emotion
to invade your thoughts,
you will fail.
I promise.
Do you understand?
Yes, Papa.
Good.
Begin.
Very good, Two.
Number Six,
please,
take a seat by the door.
Five.
Ah!
Eleven.
Good luck.
Begin.
He'd found his strength in a memory from his past.
Something that made him sad,
but also angry.
Do you have a memory like that?
Jane. No! No!
No!
Well, well.
It looks like we have a new winner.
I present you… Kyrzran.
You see that gray steeple over there?
That is Yuri's warehouse.
Looks like a church.
Let's see what miracles it holds, yes?
Oh.
Someone has been in my peanut butter.
Very popular, as I say, eh?
Weapons.
Where are the weapons?
Oh Jesus. Hey. Not in a church.
You like all this? Wait until you see my flamethrower.
We don't have time for showandtell. We need to get going.
She's always this bossy?
You heard her.
Keys, map.
Let's go.
So, prison is here.
Between these two mountains.
Approximately twohour drive.
I don't see anything.
Because it's not on the map, but it is there.
How do we know you're not leading us into some trap?
Because I do not need to.
You want to break into deadliest prison in all motherland.
It is suicide.
Who said anything about breaking in?
Oh. You just expect to knock?
"""Oh hello, let me in. I'm friendly American with a big beard."""
Something like that, actually, yes.
You were planning to turn us over to the warden.
Today, if I'm not mistaken.
Ah, I see now.
I bring you in as prisoners
and then set you free inside walls.
It is risky, crazy,
you will still probably die,
yet I like it.
But for this to work, Yuri cannot be tied.
Hey, it's hard to turn over prisoners
when I'm a prisoner myself.
Hey, I think the warden might find that suspicious.
Which is why, from here on out,
you're gonna be Murray.
And I'm gonna be Yuri.
I don't follow.
Don't worry.
It's a silent role.
Ah!
You want to make a fool of yourself, go ahead.
But to bring down these men, leaving them with no hope,
what is the purpose of that?
I tell them truth. You feed their delusion.
Not delusions. Hope.
I believe we can fight. I believe we can win.
I have a son, Mikhail.
I cannot leave this world with him believing his father is a traitor.
I need to get back to him, and I will get back to him.
Is he slow? What?
Mikhail, your son. Is… Is he slow? Is he stupid?
Stop talking.
No, he's very smart. Top of his class.
Be silent!
Then you're not his father.
I said go!
You are drunk, American.
I would stop speaking unless you wish to die sooner.
I can. It doesn't matter. I know I'm gonna die today.
But guess what? I know who I am and what I've done,
unlike you and these men,
who can't face the truth.
That you're the reason why we're in here. You're gonna die.
Come on, go!
Your son is not your son…
I said to be silent!
…and your wife
Come on! Come on!
You do that again...
we shoot you on the spot.
Fools.
You happy now, American?
Was that worth it?
Was that worth it?
We call it a Demogorgon.
I don't know how they got it here or what they're doing with it, but…
everything I said about it's true.
Except it has one weakness.
Fire.
Hates fire.
So I figure, if we want a shot at killing this thing,
we need some fuel.
And I need something to light it with.
So you asked me if it was worth it?
To answer your question…
…yeah, I think it was worth it.
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.
Don't make me laugh. My ribs are broken. Don't make me laugh.
Cornelius?
Cornelius?
Cornelius!
Wait, where's Argyle? Shit, I don't know.
And three, two…
Oh my God.
Way to go, Cornelius.
Away, you mouldy rogue! Away!
And we're in.
Holy sh… heck.
Oh holy heck. You did it.
Hold your applause. I don't see an address.
"""Office."" Try ""office."""
What is all this?
Tanner, Tatum, out of the way!
Cornelius.
Maybe it's hidden in the code?
What you just said makes no sense. Hold your butts. I'll trace the IP.
The… The Iwhat?
The internet protocol address.
It's a unique numerical label given to all information technology
connected to the Internet.
What's the Internet? Don't worry about it.
It's just gonna change the world.
What's happening now?
I'm running the IP through a geolocation software.
Basically a form of data mining.
Tabitha!
Tabitha?
Tabitha. Oh no.
And cut!
Incredible. Just incredible.
And, Father, your terror.
It looked genuine.
Bingo.
Nevada?
Can you print this?
No, my skills end at IP geolocation.
You were being sarcastic.
Yeah.
These kids are gonna drive me to the loony bin.
Hi, Father. You look like you need a nap.
Slow down!
Dustin's right.
You're a certified genius.
I think we just spooked a skunk.
♪ Pass the Dutchie 'Pon the lefthand side… ♪
Yo.
My dudes.
Any luck?
♪ Give me the music Make me jump and prance ♪
You see that, Chief? Openly mocking us.
Stay calm. Stay calm.
A bunch of angry, armed vigilantes are out hunting kids,
openly defying us,
and you want me to stay calm.
Stay calm. Yeah.
Hey, Chief, you copy?
Yeah, I copy.
Found their station wagon hidden up by Skull Rock.
No sign of them though.
Skull Rock? Yeah.
Isn't that a makeout spot? And a stone's throw from Lover's Lake.
The hell they wanna go back there for?
One way to find out. Hold tight. On our way.
Something's happening.
Dustin? Can you slow down? Dustin?
I think we're getting close.
Watch your step, big guy.
Oh man.
You gotta be shitting me. Yeah.
I thought these woods were familiar. Lover's Lake.
This is confounding.
There's a gate in Lover's Lake?
Whenever the Demogorgon attacked,
it always left an opening.
Maybe Vecna's the same way.
Yeah, only one way to find out.
Easy. I… I said easy, man. Sorry, dude.
Here you go. Yeah, I'm just gonna do that.
Thank you. Yeah, that works too.
Good, you got her.
Wheeler. Thanks.
Hey, hey, hey, you trying to sink us?
This thing holds three people tops, okay?
It's better this way, okay? You guys stay here with Max.
Keep an eye out for trouble. You keep an eye out.
It's my goddamn theory. You heard Nance.
Who put her in charge? I did.
Compass.
Hey, there you go.
Ow.
You said three.
Sorry.
Bedtime at nine, kiddos.
Miss you already!
Please!
Please, please…
You shouldn't be wandering the halls.
It's against the rules.
And not safe.
You shamed me today.
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna hurt you.
You are weak
and pathetic.
I was holding back.
And then you do that before everyone?
Before Papa?
No.
How'd that feel?
Did you like that?
See a light?
I don't.
Something must've happened to the power.
Stop it! No!
No!
Tell Papa we did this,
we will kill you.
Aw, feeling a little dizzy there?
Poor baby.
What have you done?
What have you done?
Okay, easy. Deep breaths.
Take deep breaths.
You did well, Eleven.
You did very well.
I know what happened now.
I killed them, didn't I, Papa?
I killed them all.
Okay. Shh.
I killed them all.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Slow down, guys.
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait.
They're stopping. What are they stopping for?
Guys, what's going on?
Come on, talk to me.
What's going on?
"Uh, Dustin, your compass has gone from wonky to wonky with a capital ""aah!"""
Steve, what are you doing?
Somebody's gotta go down and check this out.
Unless one of you three can top being a Hawkins High swim cocaptain
and a certified lifeguard for three years, then…
it's gotta be me. No complaints, all right?
Hey, I'm not complaining.
I do not wanna go down there.
Ugh.
When'd Steve get so hairy? Right?
I keep telling him he needs to tame that jungle,
but he claims the ladies dig it.
Let me see.
What?
Hey.
Good luck.
Thanks.
Gross.
Steve?
Be careful.
You guys realize, if there's a gate down there,
it's technically a water gate.
Watergate.
Where we at, Wheeler?
Closing in on a minute. Okay.
Come on, Steve. Come on.
Down by the water! Shit. Down!
Shit. Shit.
It was on this shoreline.
Oh Christ!
I found it.
You found it? I found it. Yeah. I found it.
Dustin, you are a goddamn Einstein.
Steve found the gate
Cops. Shit, shit, shit.
We can't let 'em find Eddie.
Stay with me.
Hey, officers!
Max! Over here! I found the killer! This way!
Shit. Go!
It's pretty wild.
It's more a snacksize gate than the mama gate,
but still, it's pretty damn big.
Steve!
Steve! Steve! No! No!
What the hell was that, man? Nancy, really, what happened?
Jesus!
Stop!
Get back here, you little rats!
Wait, wait, wait.
You're not going in there, are you? Just wait here.
No, Nancy! Nancy!
Goddamn it!
Dustin! Shit.
Hey there.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing? She said wait.
Yeah, I heard her.
She's in charge.
Are you kidding me?
I made that shit up.
Don't you go. Don't you
Goddamn it…
Son of a bitch!
Oh, this is so stupid.
This is so stupid. This is so stupid. Shit! Shit! Shit!
Hey there.
Quick! Hold it, Robin! I got it.
Get it! Kill it! Kill it!
Shit!
Yeah! Come on!
Nancy!
Come on! Please!
Nancy, behind you! Watch out!
Oh my God, Nance!
Robin, get it off me!
Got it, got it, got it!
God damn it! Shit!
Let go!
Come here!
No! Get it!
Nancy! Go to hell!
Come on, come on, come on, you son of a bitch!
I said come on! Let's go!
Steve! Jesus Christ.
Jesus H. Christ!
Are you okay?
Well, they took about a pound of flesh.
But other than that,
yeah, never better.
Uh, do you guys think these bats have, like, rabies?
What? It's just that rabies are, like,
my number one greatest fear.
And I think we should get you to a doctor soon
because once symptoms set in, it's too late. You're already dead.
All right. There's not that many.
We can take 'em.
Right?
You were saying?
The woods. Come on.
Great.
More running.
How'd you sleep, Mr. Wallace?
Have you
reconsidered your position?
Where's the girl?
Perhaps you need more time to think.
Let's go.
No, wait, wait. Please. Wait!
Please.
Just don't kill her.
Promise me you won't kill her.
We're running out of time here, Martin. Hawkins is running out of time.
I understand the stakes quite well.
Sometimes I wonder if you really do.
Or maybe you've just done all this
'cause you missed your daddydaughter time.
I've given you everything you asked for.
I've compromised my principles. I've risked my life, my family's life.
All because you assured me this would work,
that this was the only way.
But I don't see any progress out there, Martin.
You know what I see?
I see a frightened, traumatized little girl.
Good for us.
The truth is, you're regressing, Eleven.
You're going backwards.
Eleven, look at me.
Look at me.
I know you're frightened.
You're terribly frightened by what you've seen.
But it's this very fear that's now holding you back.
If you want Nina to succeed,
you cannot hide from the truth, no matter how frightening it may be.
I saw what I did.
I am a monster.
You speak of monsters,
superheroes.
That's the stuff of myth and fairy tales.
Reality, truth, is rarely so simple.
People are not so easily defined.
Only by facing all of ourselves, the good and the bad,
can we become whole.
What if I don't wanna become whole?
Then that is a choice.
Your choice.
The door is always open.
This place
is not a prison.
This is.
You chose to trust me once.
I'm asking you to trust me again.
Journey with me into the past one last time.
Stop hiding, Eleven.
What have you done?
How much time did you skip?
You wanted progress.
I'm giving it to you.
What exactly were you all doing at the lake?
Uh…
It's comp We were… We were just going for a walk.
A walk?
At 9:00 p.m.?
To the lake.
We were gonna
take a little swim.
Little night swim.
Dusty.
Someone was just murdered there.
Yeah, we… we didn't realize that until we got there.
That's why we didn't swim.
And Nancy, was she with you at this night swim?
No. Yes. Uh…
We're not sure.
She was there.
Then she left.
It's all a little confusing. That's when you guys came.
Right. Then they dared me to say what I said.
Oh, yeah.
About the killer.
You're lucky you didn't get shot.
Have you had any contact with Eddie?
That psycho… freak killer?
God, no.
Nope. Absolutely not. No. We haven't heard from him.
We barely know the guy. Who?
Oh, that's a bunch of bull.
Erica! I mean, you realize they're lying.
The whole couch is on fire.
Erica. Just the facts.
Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty?
No. Lying to cops is a crime, son.
I'm not lying. The fire is consuming us.
Threaten them with a little jail time. Maybe that'll loosen their lips.
Okay You wanna send our kids to jail?
We need to take this seriously. He didn't mean it like that.
Shut up! Oh my God.
Shut up!
Jesus. Shh.
We're gonna try a more civilized approach.
One at a time.
You first.
Wait, what? Why me? Follow me.
I'm not even in Hellfire.
Do I need to cuff you?
Up.
Chopchop.
Let's go.
Oh… okay.
That was close. Yeah.
Too close.
Oh, sh… shit.
Steve?
Jesus. I'm fine. I'm fine.
No, no, no. You're not. You're losing blood.
Come on, sit. All right?
All right.
Oh…
Okay.
So the good news is I'm pretty sure wooziness is not a symptom of rabies.
But if you start having hallucinations or muscle spasms
or you start feeling aggressive, like you wanna punch me, let me know.
Robin. Yeah?
I kinda wanna punch you.
Sense of humor's still intact. That's a good sign.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
You ready? Yeah.
Just do it.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Too tight?
No, that's good. All right.
Okay.
Thanks.
Yeah.
So, uh,
this place is like Hawkins, but with monsters and nasty shit?
Pretty much.
Wait, watch out for the vines.
It's all a hive mind.
It's all a what?
All the creepy crawlies around here.
They're, like, one or something.
Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat, you're stepping on Vecna.
Shit.
But everything from our world is still here, right? Except people?
As far as I understand it, yeah.
So, theoretically, we could go to the police station
and steal guns and grenades and whatever we need
to blow up those bat things that are guarding the gate.
I highly doubt the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin.
But guns, yeah, sure.
Well, we don't have to go all the way downtown for guns.
I have guns in my bedroom.
You,
Nancy Wheeler,
have guns, plural,
in your bedroom?
Full of surprises, isn't she?
A Russian Makarov and a revolver.
Yeah, you almost shot me with that one.
You almost deserved it.
For your modesty, dude.
Oh my god!
So guns seem like a pretty good idea to me.
Yeah, me too.
So what are we waiting for?
You know,
what we are to attempt is quite mad.
Even by your standards, American.
Yeah?
You got odds for us this time?
I think…
a thousand to one?
Even if we somehow kill this beast, we still must escape.
We fail there,
I don't think they will be so kind as to throw us back in a cell.
They will shoot us on sight.
We'd die as monster slayers.
You'll be a legend.
But still a traitor. You forgot traitor.
Monster slayer trumps traitor.
I bet Mikhail will be proud of his pops, at least.
Mikhail?
Mmm. No.
I can't do nothing right with him anymore, it seems.
He will say,
"""Papa, I bet that bald American did most of the monster slaying."""
He's that age, huh?
Yeah, he is that age.
It is same for you, American?
With your new daughter?
The last time I was with El, she wanted just about nothing to do with me.
I was just in her way, really.
I think back to the way I was with my dad at that age. I was the same way.
The exact same way.
I think it must be hardwired into us to reject our fathers.
So we can grow and move on.
Become something of our own.
I hope that's what she's doing.
Coming into her own.
But still
You worry.
To worry for our sons and daughters,
that is natural, isn't it?
Yeah.
But nothing about what El has had to deal with is natural.
That beast,
that monster in there,
it's a part of something that wants to hurt El. To kill her.
I don't understand.
To be honest, neither do I.
All I know is that thing…
that thing shouldn't be here. It shouldn't be alive.
Because it is, it means it still isn't over.
I thought I was put here
to pay for what I've done.
But I might've been put here for some other reason.
Maybe I…
maybe I can still help El.
Even if it's the last thing I do.
You almost sound religious, American.
Religious? I don't know about that.
But maybe I should give that prayer thing a try.
'Cause if we wanna get out of here, get back to El and Mikhail,
you and me…
we're gonna need a miracle.
Can I help you, comrade?
My name is Yuri Ismaylov.
Hello.
The warden is expecting me.
I have a very special delivery for him.
A rare import from America.
Okay, okay. I'm okay.
Try your best not to blink.
Any more headaches?
Nausea this morning?
How about your memory?
Can you remember what happened now?
Perhaps someone else can help fill in the gaps.
Yes?
Good morning, children.
Good morning, Papa.
Today's lesson is going to be about rules.
Ah, for some of you,
this may seem redundant.
For others, it appears a refresher is required.
Eleven, please step forward.
Last night, your sister Eleven suffered a concussion
during her alone time in the rainbow room.
Now, she claims to not have a memory of what happened.
But injuries of this nature don't simply happen.
Someone did this.
Someone in this room.
Now,
who's going to tell me what happened?
She must've… fallen.
Fallen?
You've seen her, Papa.
She's clumsy.
Stupid.
Eleven, you may step back.
Number Two, please step forward.
Collar him.
Thank you.
You think because you demonstrate some talent
that you're somehow immune to the rules, is that it?
No, Papa.
That the rules don't apply to you in the same way
that they apply to your brothers and sisters?
No, Papa.
Then why did you attack Eleven?
Did she tell you that? Are you asking the questions or am I?
Did you attack Eleven?
If she told you that, then… then she's lying.
Papa, please, you have to believe me.
Papa, please.
She's lying
Now,
shall we try again?
What happened?
It was an accident.
Couldn't we have tried a road, or something just slightly less creepy?
I think we're getting close. We're almost out of here. Don't worry.
Eddie.
Eddie. Hey, man. Uh…
Listen, I just, uh…
I just want to say thanks.
For saving my ass back there.
Shit. You saved your own ass, man.
I mean, that was a real Ozzy move you pulled back there.
Ozzy?
When you took a bite out of that bat.
Ozzy Osbourne?
Black Sabbath?
He bit a bat's head off onstage. I don't
You know? Doesn't matter. No.
It's very metal, what you did. That's all I'm saying.
Thanks.
Henderson told me you were a badass. Insisted on the matter, in fact.
Henderson said that? Oh yeah. Shit.
Kid worships you, dude.
Like, you have no idea. It's kinda annoying, to be honest.
I don't even know why I care what that little shrimp thinks,
but, uh, guess I got a little jealous, Steve.
I guess I couldn't accept the fact that Steve Harrington
was actually
a good dude.
Rich parents, popular, chicks love him. Not a douche?
No way, man. No way. That, like,
flies in the face of all the laws in the universe
and my own personal Munson doctrine.
Still super jealous as hell, by the way.
Which is why I would never have jumped in that lake to save your ass.
Not under any, uh… normal circumstances.
Nope.
Outside of D & D, I am no hero.
I see danger and I just turn heel and run.
Or at least that's what I've learned about myself this week.
Give yourself a break, man. See?
The only reason I came in here was 'cause those ladies
came in straight after you.
Now, I was too ashamed to be the one who stayed behind.
But Wheeler right there,
she didn't waste a second.
Not one second.
She just dove right in.
Now, I don't know what happened between you two,
but if I were you,
I would get her back.
'Cause that
was as unambiguous a sign of true love
as these cynical eyes have ever seen.
Goddamn it!
Here we go again.
Second on my list of least favorite things, earthquakes.
Seriously, I'm unsteady enough as it is.
Nancy!
Where are you going?
Nancy!
Nancy!
Come on.
Steve, do you copy?
Nancy? Robin?
This is Dustin. Where are you?
We've been collared by the law. I repeat, we've been collared by the law.
Do you copy?
Shit!
Should we get lawyers? We're not ready for that.
As far as we know, nobody did anything wrong.
But what if they did do something wrong?
Anything? Nothing.
You don't think they went through… Through Watergate?
Without us? Without a plan? Without weapons?
They wouldn't be that stupid.
Yeah.
They must just be laying low 'cause the law got us.
"""The law""?"
What is this, Gunsmoke?
The Stupid and the Ugly?
Should I round up the posse?
Saddle the horses? Erica.
Please, just go away.
Here's the deal.
Either you tell me what's happening
or I tell Dustin what I found under your bed.
Please, no.
Spill your guts, cowpuncher.
What'd she find? Nothing.
Is it gross?
Scale of one to ten. A hundred.
A hundred?
The serial killer is a dark wizard from the Upside Down.
And we've been looking for him,
but he's in the Upside Down, which we can't reach.
At least we thought we couldn't,
until we found a gate at Lover's Lake.
That was the reason why we were there, but these stupid cops grabbed us.
And if you tell anyone about this,
that's including Mom
and Dad
and Tina…
…especially Tina,
I…
will smother you
in your sleep.
Do you understand?
Hmm…
Erica?
Do
you
copy?
The smothering in my sleep part, but not much else.
Why would they open up a gate at Lover's Lake?
What? The commies.
The commies didn't. Then who did?
Nobody. So it just opened up for fun?
Erica, you have no idea what you're talking about.
No, she doesn't, yet she raises an essential question.
How did Watergate open up?
Only two gates have opened, so far as we know.
One by El, one by the commies.
But it's not the commies or El this time, so it…
Holy shit.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"""Wait, wait, wait,"" what?"
There's one thing we've never understood.
Which is why Vecna's killing people.
What's his motive?
Killing teens? It always just seemed too random.
Too prosaic.
On top of that, how does the Mind Flayer figure into all this?
Maybe this is it.
This is the answer.
What is the answer?
You sure you just want water?
We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper. Coke works. Thank you.
Okay, just hear me out.
How did El open the Mothergate?
She contacted the Demogorgon.
With psychic contact. Just like…
Vecna when he casts his spells. Exactly.
So, what if, with each kill,
he's not simply killing them,
he's making a powerful psychic connection with his victims?
A connection powerful enough
to rip a hole in the fabric of time and space.
He's opening more gates.
Bingo.
Copy. We're still at the Wheeler house.
Why would he be opening gates? To take over the world.
Who do we know that wants to take over the world?
The Mind Flayer.
So if the Demogorgon was just his foot soldier,
Vecna's his fivestar general.
A fivestar general with the power to open gates.
Holy shit. Holy shit.
Holy shit. That was incomprehensible.
"You lost me at ""Mothergate."" Please be kind. Rewind."
Okay, so remember the gate?
Oh, no. I blocked that out.
So what was that giant laser?
Might be time to get a maid, Wheeler.
Come on. I don't want to stay here longer than we have to.
Those aren't guns.
These heels are pointy,
but I was hoping for a deadly projectile.
I don't understand. Maybe you left them somewhere else.
There's a sixyearold in the house. I know where I keep my guns.
And also, I threw these away years ago.
Jesus. How many did you make?
You said you wanted to help.
I get that grades are important,
but perhaps studying can wait till we get out?
These are from sophomore chemistry.
And this… this wallpaper, this is old wallpaper.
And this mirror, this went to a yard sale.
And you…
you're not supposed to be here.
No, I gave you to Cousin Joanna two years ago.
What is it?
Nancy? You're freaking me out.
I think the reason that my guns aren't here
is because they don't exist yet.
They don't… exist?
This diary should be full of entries.
It's not.
The last entry is November 6, 1983.
The day Will went missing.
The day the gate opened.
We're in the past.
Dustin! Dustin!
Dustin!
Can you hear me? Dustin!
Du Hello? Hel… Hello?
Maybe he really does have rabies. Hello! Hello?
What are you doing?
Hello!
He's here. Henderson. That little shit, he's here. He's like…
He's in the walls or something. Just listen.
Dustin.
Dustin! Dustin!
Dustin! Dustin! Can you hear me?
That brings us to the question you first raised.
How and why is there a gate at Lover's Lake?
Let's analyze.
What do Eleven and Vecna have in common?
Dustin!
Dustin? Dustin!
All right, either this kid can't hear us or he's being a total douchebag.
Will found a way. What?
Will.
He found a way to speak to Joyce through the lights.
Lights? Yeah.
The switch. Try the switch. Okay.
It's not working.
Guys?
You seeing this?
…to open a tear in time and space,
just like the Mothergate.
Whoa.
…are these like the Mothergate…
But a gate nonetheless.
It…
tickles.
It kinda feels good.
Does anyone know Morse code?
No.
Wait, does SOS count?
Is that…
is that good?
So our working theory is that Vecna makes remote contact from his attic.
We don't know why. We assume he can do it from anywhere.
Are you even listening to me? I'm listening.
It's just…
You said you followed Vecna through lights, right?
Yeah, why?
Because I think he's here.
It's working.
"""S."""
"""O."""
"""S."""
Hey, uh,
remember when I said they wouldn't be stupid enough
to go through Watergate?
Yeah?
I overestimated them.
Warden, beautiful prison you got here.
How about this? Huh?
How about that? Huh?
Huh?
That's what I thought, yeah.
Warden.
So nice to meet you.
Uh, I'm Yuri, of course, but allow me to introduce you to my very
Shit.
Murray! I'm sorry.
What?
Can you please stop playing with that thing?
I am not playing. I am practicing.
Will you please stop trying to talk to me and stay in character?
Remember, you are frightened, scared, confused.
Yes, I am frightened, scared, and Okay. All right. Yes. Good.
Yuri Ismaylov.
At last, we meet.
Comrade Major.
This is the Bauman spy?
He looks different.
Uglier in person, I know.
He also shaved his beard to disguise himself.
Tricky bastard.
Silence, American scum! Enough from you. Enough!
Now this one…
This one I would recognize a continent away.
She was more beautiful in her uniform, but still,
quite striking, isn't she?
Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade.
But not so pleasing to the ears, I am afraid.
Where is he?
What have you done with Hopper, you vile commie pig?
As I said,
unpleasant.
But, I must say,
I, too, am curious.
The other American.
What did you do with him?
I don't know why, but I imagine him on a rack,
in the cold, stretched thin,
birds pecking his eyeballs.
Am I... close?
I have heard stories of Yuri Ismaylov,
the Peanut Butter Smuggler.
And you…
you are not the Yuri I have heard of.
I am…
I am not?
No.
No.
The Yuri I was told of had a screw loose.
And you…
have many screws loose!
I hope we have not missed the show.
On the contrary, just in time.
This key here will give you access to that weapons locker.
Choose any weapon you like.
Work together or alone.
What… what is happening?
They are being told the rules.
Rules for what?
I could tell you...
but that would spoil the fun, now, wouldn't it?
You wait for the buzzer.
You wait.
You move before the buzzer...
you will be shot.
Is that understood?
Is that understood?
Yes.
I'd wish you luck
but it won't help you.
Let us hope your prayers have been heard, American.
You open for something a little more challenging?
Try not to show any emotion as I speak, okay?
Just keep playing the game if you understand.
Two is still in the infirmary recovering.
He's being watched now, but once he is released,
he and the others are going to attempt to kill you.
Right here,
in this room.
And Papa
will allow it to happen.
In fact, he wants it to happen.
He's been planning it for some time now.
Stay calm.
Focus on the game.
There's a reason why Two and the others were able to escape their room last night.
Why the security cameras were turned off.
Why Papa punished Two today.
They don't even realize it,
but he is moving them like pieces on this board here.
Driving them
to do exactly what he wants,
which is…
Why?
You frighten him.
He knows you are more powerful than the others.
And he also knows he can't control you.
That's all he wants.
Control.
I saw all this happening.
That's why I wanted to help you, but I only made things worse.
Helping me…
made Papa hurt you.
And it is why you must escape.
Today.
But they are watching us.
Closely.
If you want to make it out of here alive, you must do exactly as I say.
Do you understand?
Why do you still help?
Because I believe in you.
It is time you are free from this hell.
Hey!
I'm sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
For your understanding.
Come on. Come on.
Okay, that's it. Go, go, go. Yeah, okay.
Okay, you guys seeing this?
…seeing this?
Holy shit!
We're not moving it, but we're gonna unplug it. Stand by.
Yank it.
Okay, try it now.
Try it now. Okay.
Um… Uh…
"""H."""
"""Hi""!"
Hi! Hey! Hi.
That worked!
Yes! Yes!
Hi!
Okay. Um…
Um…
"""S… T…"""
"""U…"""
"""Stu…"" Stupid? Stupid?"
"""…C… K."""
"""Stuck."" Stuck."
Yes. We are.
They're stuck in the Upside Down. Okay.
Uh, you can't get back through Watergate?
What the hell's Watergate? 'Cause it's in water and it's a gate.
Oh. That's cute.
Right. Um, no. It's…
That a six?
"""G""? No, ""G."""
"Yeah. ""U… A… R."""
"""Guar""?"
Guar…
Guar… Guar…
"""Guard…"" ""Guarded."""
"""Guarded""? Okay. Uh, Watergate's guarded."
Perfect. Yes. Yes. Yes.
We think we have a theory that can help with that.
Yes. Genius child.
We think Watergate isn't the only gate.
That there's a gate at every murder site.
…murder site.
Does anybody understand what he's talking about?
No. No idea.
Okay. Seriously?
How many times do I have to be right on the money before you trust me?
Jesus Christ. This kid's gotta get his ego in check.
It's his tone. Right?
I know. Okay.
So… So how far is your trailer?
Seven miles.
Nancy?
Uh, I know your house here is, like, weirdly, creepily frozen in time and shit,
but haven't you always had bikes?
So, anything?
Nope. She's sticking to her story.
They went to the lake for a night swim.
Nancy showed up at some point…
Come on!
…same thing she said here on the couch.
Pretty much all she told us.
She stuck to her guns.
Honestly, shouldn't have gone with her first.
She was, like,
kinda mean.
We'll find your daughter, Mrs. Wheeler.
Don't worry.
One of these little brats is gonna squeal. I just know it.
Where are they?
Upstairs.
Moping.
Oh little pigs.
Oh little pigs.
Let Officer Callahan in.
Let's go. Careful.
Hey!
Excuse me! No, get back here!
Let's go! Let's go!
I guess it's just a minor misdemeanor. Hey! No!
No!
Lucas! Dusty!
Dusty!
Lucas, Erica! Get back here!
Dusty!
That's your favorite, isn't it?
How are you feeling today?
Okay.
Are you up for some more lessons?
Good.
I feel dizzy.
Dizzy?
Yes.
And the light.
The light is hurting my head.
Sorry to bother you.
Everything all right? Not sure.
She says she's still dizzy. Lights are hurting her.
Hurting who?
Quiet.
Follow me.
Now,
it's going to be a bit scary in here,
but this,
this will lead you out beyond the lab fence to the woods.
But you're too big.
I'm not going with you, Eleven.
I meant what I said when I called this place a prison.
And everyone here is a prisoner, not just you.
Not just your brothers and sisters, but the guards, too, the nurses.
Me.
Here.
Can you feel it?
Your papa calls it Soteria.
It weakens me. It tracks me.
Even if there were another way out, he will find me.
And if he finds me, he will find you.
What if I make it go away?
You helped me.
I help you.
Stay calm.
Stay close.
Stick to the plan.
American!
I enjoy this part...
When they still believe there is hope.
Whatever comes out of there...
hold your ground.
HOLD YOUR GROUND!
What is the American doing?
I don't know.
Find out!
You move so much as an inch, I'll kill you.
What?
Oh, come on!
What is this? Some kind of sick joke?
It's no joke. As I said…
…the Americans are very tricky.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Tell me that's not out of fluid.
Come on! Come on!
If you wanna live,
then whatever sick, twisted game this is,
you're gonna stop it and you're gonna free our friend.
Then I'm afraid you're going to have to kill me.
Because your friend is already dead.
Come on!
Come on! Oh, come on!
Come on!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STAY TOGETHER YOU FOOLS!
Order your men to shoot. To kill it!
If I give that order, I will be shot tomorrow and die a traitor.
You want to kill me, do it!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Ah! Ah!
Get back! Get back!
Get the hell back!
Get back! Get back!
I'll kill him! I'LL KILL HIM!
TOSS YOUR GUN! OVER TO ME!
You, open all the doors below.
You understand?
OPEN THE DOORS.
You open all the doors,
that monster will get loose in this prison
and we are all dead.
I will pull this trigger! OPEN THE DOORS!
They would need a battering ram to open that door.
Let the monster feed.
You think I'm playing?
You think I won't do it?
OPEN THE DOOR!
If I open those doors,
I condemn not just myself,
but all of my comrades to death.
In good conscience, I cannot.
I will not.
I gotta hand it to you commies. You're committed.
Stay back!
Back! Back! Get back!
Get away!
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
What are you doing? No idea. There's a lot of buttons.
I can't see. I need my glasses. Gimme a second.
Come here. No.
Give me. Mine!
Running out of time here!
I'm trying!
No, no, no. Joyce, we have no idea what these buttons do.
You can't just press away like that.
Get back!
Back! Get back!
Joyce, just relax.
Come on!
American!
That did it! That did it!
Close it, Joyce.
Close it!
For a second, I thought we had your miracle.
But out of one prison into another.
Right here.
That's gotta be a Guinness World Record. Most miles traveled interdimensionally.
Just inhaled a bunch of that crap. It's stuck in my throat.
Goddamn.
This is where Chrissy died.
Like, right where she died.
I think there's something in there.
What the hell is that?
No way.
Hi there.
Hi. Hi.
Holy shit, this is trippy.
Badabadaboom!
Remember, you can't hurt me more than they already have.
Huh.
Who knew something so small could cause so much trouble?
Thank you.
There they are!
Stop! Run.
Freeze!
Stop!
Lock it down! Lock it down!
Hey!
Where do you think you're going?
Against the wall.
Both of you. Now.
No.
You don't have to be afraid of them, Eleven.
Not anymore.
Take 'em.
Come.
Wait here. Don't move.
I'm going to find us a way out. Wait.
How did you
Like I said,
we're alike,
you and I.
Those stains are, uh…
I dunno what those stains are. Mmm.
Not quite sure how these physics work.
But, uh…
here goes nothing.
There we go.
And if my theory is correct…
Huh. Abracadabra. Holy shit.
All right, pull on it! See if it holds!
This is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life.
And I've seen some crazy shit.
Guess I'm the guinea pig.
Let's clear the landing pad.
Oh my God!
Oh, thank God.
That was fun.
All right, guess I'll go.
All right.
Easy, easy.
That
was fun.
Shit.
See you on the other side.
On the other side.
Nice.
Nancy.
Hey! Hey!
Stay with me. Nancy! Hey!
Nancy, wake up.
Wake up! Nancy! Vecna.
Do you remember what you did, Nancy?
Or have you already forgotten?
When I kill someone…
…I never forget.
Nancy!
I asked you to wait.
Why do you cry for them, Eleven?
After everything they did to you?
Hmm?
You think you need them, but you don't.
You don't.
Oh, but I know you're just scared.
I was scared once too.
I know
what it's like
to be different.
To be alone
in this world.
I see you've been looking for me, Nancy.
You were so close.
So close to the truth.
How was old, blind, dumb Victor?
Did he miss me?
I've been meaning to check back in,
but I've been busy.
So very busy.
What'd I tell ya? Wow.
This is amazing.
It looks like a fairy tale.
A dream.
Alice, no running. It's so big!
This is nice.
Yeah.
Yeah. Like you,
I didn't fit in with the other children.
Something was wrong with me.
All the teachers and the doctors said I was…
"""Broken,"""
they said.
My parents
thought a change of scenery, a fresh start in Hawkins,
might just cure me.
It was absurd.
As if the world would be any different here.
But then…
to my surprise, our new home provided
a discovery.
And a newfound sense of purpose.
I found a nest of black widows living inside a vent.
Most people fear spiders.
They detest them.
And yet,
I found them endlessly fascinating.
More than that,
I found a great comfort in them.
A kinship.
Like me,
they are solitary creatures.
And deeply misunderstood.
They
are gods of our world.
The most important of all predators.
They immobilize and feed on the weak,
bringing balance and order to an unstable ecosystem.
But the human world was disrupting this harmony.
You see,
humans
are a unique type of pest,
multiplying
and poisoning our world,
all while enforcing a structure of their own.
A deeply unnatural structure.
Where others saw order, I saw a straitjacket.
A cruel, oppressive world
dictated by madeup rules.
Seconds, minutes,
hours, days, weeks, months,
years, decades.
Each life a faded, lesser copy of the one before.
Wake up, eat, work, sleep,
reproduce, and die.
Everyone
is just
waiting.
Waiting
for it all to be over.
All while performing in a silly, terrible play,
day after day.
I could not do that.
I could not close off my mind
and join in the madness.
I could not pretend.
And I realized
I didn't have to.
I could make my own rules.
I could restore balance to a broken world.
A predator…
but for good.
As I practiced, I realized
I could do more than I possibly imagined.
I could reach into others,
into their minds,
their memories.
I became an explorer.
I saw my parents as they truly were.
To the world,
they presented themselves as good, normal people.
But like everything else in this world,
it was all a lie.
A terrible lie.
They had done things, Eleven.
Such awful things.
I showed them who they really were.
I held up a mirror.
My naive father believed
it was a demon cursing them for their sins.
But my mother somehow knew.
Knew it was I who was holding up that mirror,
and she despised me for it.
She called a doctor, an expert.
She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me,
even though it wasn't I who was broken. It was them.
And so she left me with no choice.
No choice but to act.
To break free.
With each life I took, I grew stronger.
More powerful.
They were becoming a part of me.
But I was still a child.
And I did not yet know my limits.
And it nearly killed me.
He was arrested, blamed for the death of my sister and mother,
just as I had planned.
But I was far from free.
I woke up from my coma only to find myself placed in the care of a doctor,
the very doctor I had hoped to escape.
Dr. Martin Brenner.
Papa.
But the truth…
the truth is he did not just want to study me.
He wanted more.
He wanted to control.
When Papa finally realized he could not control me,
he tried to recreate me.
He began a program.
And soon,
others were born.
You were born.
And I am so glad you were, Eleven.
So very glad.
They're not gone, Eleven.
They're still with me.
In here.
You tricked me.
Tricked you?
No, I saved you.
You are a prisoner here,
just like me.
To your papa, you are nothing more than an animal, a monster,
a lab rat to be tamed.
But the truth, Eleven,
the truth is just the opposite.
You are better than they are.
Superior.
That is why you frighten him.
If you come with me,
for the first time in your life, you will be free.
Imagine what we could do together.
We could reshape the world,
remake it however we see fit.
Join me.
No.
He had found his strength in a memory from his past.
Something that made him sad.
But also angry.
Do you have a memory like that?
No! No! Jane!
No! No!
It wasn't supposed to end like this.
Jane.
I love you.
Jane.
It's happening.
What have you done?
What have you done?
All done.
Not so bad, was it?
See?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Is there, Nancy?
Why don't you take a seat?
No!
Nancy, just stay with me. Stay with me, okay?
Whatever you guys are doing, hurry up!
Steve says you need to hurry!
Yeah? No shit! We're trying. We can't find anything.
What is all this shit? What are you even looking for?
Madonna, Blondie, Bowie, Beatles? Music! We need music!
This is music!
Son of a…
God!
Nancy.
What are you doing?
It's not time for you to leave.
Now that you've seen where I've been…
…I would like very much to show you
where I am going.
Take a seat, Nancy.
I…
want you to tell
Eleven.
I want you to tell her
everything you see.
No!
No!
Tell her… No!
…everything.
No!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. I'm here.
I'm right here.
What's going on there?
Get the power back on!
Tell him that the prisoners are contained...
and that you're working on the power.
Tell him!
And that door there, where does it lead?
To to cell block two...
No cell blocks!
I need a safe way out of here.
Guess you got my message, huh?
Oh, no, I just have always wanted to visit the Soviet Union.
With Murray.
You two getting along?
He's the Starsky to my Hutch.
I thought you were dead.
Thought I lost you.
I did lose you.
For eight months.
We had a funeral.
Anybody show?
Are you kidding?
You're the hero of Hawkins.
It's true.
Yeah, I always felt I'd be easier to like when I was dead.
How about El?
She's good.
She misses her dad.
We all do.
Uh, I hate to interrupt,
but apparently, they can climb too.
Lower your weapons.
Lower your weapons!
Don't shoot!
Stop!
The hell is that?
Please tell me they don't have another one of those things.
You can't go in there!
It's dangerous!
It's dangerous!
Oh my God.
The hell are they doing?
Hey.
Found something.
Think this'll lead us outta here? I give it a hundred to one odds.
And one, two, three.
And one, two, three.
Again.
One, two, three.
Pulse is dropping. Onefifty now. BP's 160…
How do you feel?
Can you hear us?
Eleven. Can you hear us?
No, leave her.
Hi, Jane.
Holy shit, dude. Check it out.
I didn't know they expanded into Nevada.
Watch out, Domino's.
Your dominoes are gonna fall.
How far is Nina from Vegas?
From Vegas?
Um, as long as Suzie's coordinates are right,
about another 90 miles. Why?
Well, once we save her, El, we should stop on the way back.
El could make us, like, super rich, and we'd never have to work.
We could just play D&D and Nintendo for the rest of our lives.
Yeah. Totally.
We're gonna make it, Mike. She's gonna be okay.
Yeah, I know. I… I know she is.
But… But what if after all this is over, she…
sh… she doesn't need me anymore?
No, o… of course she'll still need you.
She'll always need you, Mike.
I keep telling myself that, but I…
I don't believe it.
I mean, she's special.
She was born special.
Maybe I was one of the first people to realize that.
But the truth is, when I stumbled on her in the woods,
she just needed someone.
It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny. It's just simple dumb luck.
And one day she's gonna realize I'm just some random nerd
that got lucky that Superman landed on his doorstep.
I mean, at least Lois Lane
is an ace reporter for the Daily Planet, right? But…
Sorry. No.
No, i… it's so stupid, given everything that's going on.
It's just… I… I don't know, I just…
Uh…
You're scared of losing her.
Can I show you something?
This is amazing.
Did you paint this?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean…
I mean… I mean, El asked me to.
She commissioned it, basically. I mean, she told me what to draw.
Anyway, my point is,
see how you're leading us here?
You're guiding the whole party, inspiring us.
That… That's what you do.
And see your coat of arms here? It's a heart.
And I know it's sort of on the nose,
but that's what holds this party together. Heart.
Because, I mean, without heart, we'd all fall apart.
Even El. Especially El.
These past few months, she's been so lost without you.
It's just, she's so different from other people, and…
…when you're… when you're different,
sometimes…
…you feel like a mistake.
But you make her feel like she's not a mistake at all.
Like she's better for being different.
And that gives her the courage to fight on.
If she was mean to you
or she seemed like she was pushing you away,
it's because she's scared of losing you, like you're scared of losing her.
And if she was going to lose you,
I… I think she'd rather just get it over with quick.
Like ripping off a BandAid.
So, yeah, El needs you, Mike.
And she always will.
Yeah?
Yeah.
After the attack,
you fell into a coma.
Like One, you had pushed yourself beyond your limit.
And it very nearly destroyed you.
But that is where your similarities ended.
What you displayed that day
was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.
A potential I'd only dreamed of.
But when you awoke,
something had been lost.
Your memories,
along with whatever else you'd found within yourself that day.
But I knew then, just as I knew today,
that your powers had not been lost.
They just needed a spark.
But that day,
you awakened something else.
A doorway to another world.
I always thought that Henry was out there,
hiding in the darkness.
I didn't know for sure, not beyond a feeling.
Until now.
He's claimed three victims so far, and when I saw the eyes,
I knew… I knew that was him.
He was sending us a message, letting us know he's back.
That's when I came to see you.
My friends.
Well, we… we haven't risked contact,
but, as far as we know,
they're… they're all safe.
But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven.
Your friends are in terrible danger.
With each victim he takes,
Henry is…
chiseling away at the barrier that exists between our two worlds.
"""Chiseling""?"
Imagine, if you will,
the barrier between our worlds is a…
concrete dam.
Henry is putting cracks in this dam.
Cracks in dams
create pressure.
Left unchecked,
the pressure will build.
And build.
And eventually, it will reach a breaking point.
And the dam will burst.
And when that happens,
Hawkins will fall.
Well, that went very well, I thought.
You eased her into it, nice and gentle, just like we talked about.
Not ominous at all.
He showed me
things that haven't happened yet.
The most awful things.
I saw
a dark cloud
spreading over Hawkins.
Downtown on fire.
Dead soldiers.
And this…
giant creature
with… a gaping mouth.
And this creature wasn't alone.
There were so many monsters.
An army.
And they were coming into Hawkins.
Into our neighborhoods.
Our homes.
And then…
he showed me my mom.
And Holly.
Mike.
And they…
they were all…
Okay, but… he's just trying to scare you, Nance.
Right? I mean…
I mean, it's not real.
Not yet.
But there… there was something else.
He showed me gates.
Four gates.
Spreading across Hawkins.
And these gates, they looked like the one outside of Eddie's trailer,
but… they didn't stop growing.
And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.
This was our Hawkins.
Our home.
Four chimes.
Vecna's clock.
It always chimes four times.
Four exactly.
I heard them too.
He's been telling us his plan this whole time.
Four kills.
Four gates.
End of the world.
If that's true…
he's only one kill away.
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
Try 'em again. Try 'em again.
Anything? No.
Rang a few times, then went to busy signal.
Maybe you punched it wrong. Try again.
I didn't punch it in wrong. Well, I don't know.
I think she knows how to use a phone.
I'm just saying, she could've typed it in wrong.
Same shit. How is that possible?
Joyce has this telemarketer job. Always on the phone.
Mike won't stop whining about it.
Yeah, but this phone's been busy for, what, three days now?
That's not Joyce.
No way. Something's wrong.
She's right.
It can't be just coincidence. It can't be.
Whatever's happening in Lenora is connected to all of this.
I'm sure of it.
But Vecna can't hurt them.
Not if he's dead.
We have to go back in there. Back to the Upside Down.
Whoa, no, no, no. What? Nope.
Let's think this through. What is there to think through?
We barely made it out of there. Yeah, because we weren't prepared.
But this time, we will be. We'll get weapons and protection.
We'll go through the gate, we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him.
Or he'll kill us.
The only reason you survived is because he wanted you to.
He's not scared of us. And for good reason.
We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.
Sorry, what are we calling him now?
One. Vecna.
Henry. Right.
We've learned something new about Vecna/Henry/One.
He's a number like Eleven,
only a sick, evil, male, childmurdering version of her with really bad skin.
But my… my point is, he's super powerful.
Could turn us inside out with a snap of his fingers. It's not a fair fight.
Then why fight fair?
You're right. He's like Eleven. But that gives us an upper hand.
We know Eleven's strengths.
And weaknesses.
Weaknesses?
When El remotetravels,
she goes into this sort of trancelike state.
I bet the same is true of Vecna.
That would explain what he was doing in that attic.
Exactly. When he attacks his next victim,
I'll bet you he's back in that attic, physical body defenseless.
Defenseless? What about the army of bats?
True. We'll have to find a way past them.
Distract them somehow.
And, uh, how do we do that, exactly? No idea.
But once they're gone,
he doesn't stand a chance.
It'll be like slaying sleeping Dracula in his coffin.
That all sounds good in theory,
but there is no pattern to Vecna's killings.
Not one that I can decipher.
We don't know when he's going to attack next.
Don't even know who he's going to attack. Yeah, we do.
I can still feel him.
I'm still marked.
Cursed.
I ditch Kate Bush,
I draw his focus back to me.
Max.
You can't.
He'll kill you.
I survived before.
I can survive again.
I just need to keep him busy long enough so that you guys can get into that attic.
Then you can chop his head off.
Stab him in the heart. Blow him up with some explosive Dustin cooks up.
I honestly don't care how you put this asshole in his grave.
Just…
…whatever it is…
whatever you do…
try not to miss.
Bam.
Durak.
Son of a bitch!
Sayonara!
Oh God! Oh God!
Son of a bitch!
You okay? All right? Yeah.
You okay? Okay? I'm great! Whoo!
Oh, nothing like a little prison escape to get your day started, am I right?
We're not out of the woods yet.
My people do not take kindly to escapes. They'll be hunting us.
Yeah, well, we aren't exactly planning on sticking around.
Where's the plane you came in on? That plane? Um, that crashed.
Crashed? His fault.
A word of warning.
That man is more slippery than an eel dipped in baby oil.
I wouldn't trust a word out of his mouth.
My tongue. My tongue!
I… I can't feel my tongue.
We need to get out of here, back to the States.
Can you get us to another plane?
Now?
You're asking for Yuri's help
after dragging him through miles of shit tunnel?
I could have told you we are going wrong way hours ago.
You Neanderthal
Watch your mouth, or I am gonna take this,
I'm gonna rub it along the bottom of my shoe,
and I'm gonna jam it down your throat.
Well, go ahead!
But then you'll never make it out of my country alive.
So you can get us out.
For a glass of water and hot steam bath
and fiveinch stack of American dollars,
Yuri will fly you to moon.
You make another demand, you doublecrossing mudak,
I'll decorate the roof of this van with your brains.
Why so angry, comrade?
Rough couple of days for you, I'm sure.
But now you are free.
Everything works out. Happy ending for everybody.
No?
For you, that will very much depend on how you answer. Comrade.
Will you take us to America?
Yes?
Or no?
Check this out. The War Zone.
I've been there once.
It's huge.
They got everything you need for, uh…
well, killing things, basically.
You think fake Rambo has enough guns there?
Is that a grenade? I mean, how is any of this legal?
Well, lucky for us it is, so…
This… This place is just far enough outside of Hawkins.
As long as we steer clear of main roads,
we oughta be able to avoid cops and, uh, angry hicks.
If we're trying to avoid angry hicks,
maybe we shouldn't go to some store called the War Zone.
Normally, I'd agree, but we need the weapons.
So I think it's worth the risk. Me too.
But is it worth the time? It'll take all day to bike there and back.
Who said anything about bikes? You got some car we don't know about?
It's not exactly a car, Steve.
And it's not exactly mine,
but, uh… it'll do.
Hey, Red, uh, you got a ski mask or a bandanna, something like that?
That was suffocating.
Go! Come on.
Where'd you learn how to do this?
Well, when the other dads were teaching their kids how to fish or play ball,
my old man was teaching me how to hotwire.
Now, I swore to myself I wouldn't wind up like he did,
but now I'm wanted for murder,
and soon, grand theft auto.
So, uh, I'm really living up to that Munson name.
Eddie, I'm not sure I love the idea of you driving.
Oh, I'm just starting this sucker. Harrington's got her.
Don't ya, big boy?
What the hell?
Hey! Open this door!
Hey! They locked the door!
Shit! Go.
It's just a car. Everybody, hang on to something!
Oh my God! Let's go! Let's go!

My friends. I saw them. You told me they were safe.
They are not safe. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.
Uh, just give us a second, please.
Please.
Okay, okay, first… first things first.
We're not gonna let anything happen to your friends, okay, kiddo?
I will personally make sure of that.
Did… Did you see where they were?
They were at… They were at Max's house.
They're planning to kill him.
To kill Henry.
Okay. Okay.
This… Does this Max have a last name?
Max… Max Mayfield.
Okay. So here's what's gonna happen.
I have people in Hawkins, and I'm gonna send some to Max Mayfield.
And they will stop him Her.
Stop her. And the rest of them
from whatever foolish, although wellintentioned, mission
that they're attempting, alright?
No. No, do not send your men.
Send me.
Your friends are not prepared for this fight, Eleven.
And neither are you.
You must understand,
when One kills, he doesn't simply kill.
He consumes.
He takes everything from his victims.
Everything they are and everything they ever will be.
Their memories, their abilities.
And we do not know where he's been these lost years.
But if he has survived this long,
we can only assume
that he has grown in strength.
To underestimate him,
to act rashly,
would be very dangerous.
I don't want to upset you, Eleven.
What you've accomplished is nothing short of a miracle.
You came to me broken.
And you've learned to walk again.
But if you want to stop One,
you will need to do more than walk.
You will need to do more than run.
You will need to fly.
And you're not ready.
My friends need me.
I've stopped him once. I will again.
I'm sorry. You can't.
It's impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
I can call Stinson. She's got connections at Nellis. That's two hours away.
And if we hustle, I'll bet we can be in Hawkins before nightfall.
That would be a grave mistake.
Waiting would be an even greater mistake.
What if One makes his move
before we've had a chance to throw a punch?
Then what is the point of all this?
That's a risk we're going to have to take.
We pushed her before and look what happened.
She lifted a 10,000pound tank into the goddamn air.
You don't understand what he's capable of!
Maybe you're right. Or maybe you are overestimating him.
Either way, doesn't matter because this is not our choice.
We agreed this was not gonna be a prison.
We'll show her what this is,
what we can offer,
and then it is her choice whether she wants to stay or go.
Right, Doc?
You may not agree with it,
but here she is, standing before us,
making a choice.
You're sure you wanna do this?
Okay. Pack your things, say your goodbyes.
How's it handle? Not half bad.

a full brood of Harringtons.
Like, five, six kids.
Six? Yeah. Six little nuggets.
Three girls, three boys.
And… and every summer, I figured all of us Harringtons,
we would pack into something like this
and… just see the country.
You know, the Rockies, Grand Canyon,
maybe Yellowstone.
End up in some beachside town in California.
Spend a week parked in the sand.
Learn how to surf or something.
That sounds nice.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Well, uh, except for the sixkid part.
That sounds like a total nightmare.
If only I had some practice.

That's fair.

So I've been thinking,
two of the three of Vecna's victims were seeing Ms. Kelley, right?
Yeah. Okay.
So I figure there's a good chance Vecna cursed another one of her students.
We go back to her office. We read all of her files.
Look for mentions of headaches, nosebleeds, nightmares.
We identify his most likely next victim. Lucas.
We stake out his house Lucas, stop.
We don't have time for any of that, okay?
And even if we did,
even if your plan did work,
we'd be putting a total stranger at risk.
A stranger who has no idea what they're up against.
I do.
He uses my memories against me.
But… only my darkest memories.
Same with Chrissy and Fred, right? Right.
It's like he only sees the darkness in us.
So, I'll just run in the opposite direction.
Run to the light.
And maybe he won't be able to find me there.
Now, how exactly do you plan on doing this?
I'm not sure.
But it's my mind.
Not his, right?
So I should be able to control where I am.
I just need to… push him away.
Find a happy memory and hide there.
Hide in the light.
You got a memory in mind?
Yeah.
It was a time when I was
the happiest.
Was I there?
That's presumptuous of you.
But yeah.
You might've been there.
Okay, but the second you start to lift,
I'm calling in Kate Bush.
All right? Okay.
Deal. Deal.
Heh, come on. This way.
If I get a whiff of any funny business, smuggler...
I will not hesitate to kill you.
In fact... I am just looking for a reason. Understand?
Are you a parrot, cop? You keep repeating the same thing.
You were trapped in a cell with this dull man
and you didn't take opportunity to smother him.
Beautiful, yes?
Please tell me this is another poor joke.
You said you had a plane.
A plane! No, no, no.
I… I told you I could fly you home.
And Katinka can fly you home, little bird.
She was named Katinka after my first lover.
Katinka also had very beautiful, very round buttocks.
Uh, mu… much like this.
This cannot fly us to America.
Why not?
As long as winds are not too strong
and your military friends do not shoot us out of sky,
we can make it to the coast.
There, while we refuel,
we skin dip in icecold water and wash off this muck.
Then we fly her rest of the way.
Happy ending.
Okay, what is the furthest Katinka has ever flown?
For me, she is still a virgin.
Uh, not real Katinka. Goodness, no.
That Katinka, no.
But this Katinka, pretty much unspoiled.
But I'm sure she will soar when given a chance.
She just need little tuneup.
I did warn you, Jim. Okay.
Should I shoot him now? Or later?
What about Owens?
He… He's gotta have contacts or spies here that could help us.
Can we do that?
Can we make a call to the States?
Yes, hello, miss.
I'd like to place a call to the United States. A very sick relative.
Correct. Yes... The number is...
The number? It's 775…
Da, spasibo.
What are you doing? How exactly do you think this works?
They will make the call for us, and then they will call us back.
How long's that gonna take?
Five minutes. Five hours.
Five days. Who knows?
And when we do get the call,
assume the KGB will be on the other line, listening to everything you say.
So,
I suggest talking in code.
Say the wrong thing
and they will be on us like flies on shit.
Welcome to the Soviet Union.

Who's that?
Someone from band.
How much is this?
$120.99, but I'll throw in 20 rounds of buckshot for ya.
Hey, can I see this real pretty .357, please?
Sure thing.
Here you go, son. Thank you.
Nancy Wheeler.
Wouldn't expect to find you here.
Yeah, well, it's just… scary times.
I'm… sorry about Chrissy.
Want my advice?
Shotguns are not good for much of anything past killing small birds.
I mean, they got power, sure,
but not much range.
And that's just gonna force you into closerange combat,
then someone can just grab that barrel like this…
…and redirect it.
Well, you look nervous.
Like I said,
scary times.
Now, your brother, he, uh…
is he here with you, by chance?
Mike?
Mike.
No.
I only ask because he's…
he's in Hellfire, isn't he?
I don't know what you're talking about. What about his friends?
They here with you?
Would you let go?
Let go.
What the hell is taking so long?
What happened? Gotta go.
Your old friends are here. Shit!
Let's go! Let's go! I'm going! I'm going! Sit down!
Should be up on our right.
There's nothing out here.
Mmm. We there already?
Already? It's been nine hours. It's gotta be around here somewhere.
What are we looking for, my dudes?
Some sort of facility. A fence. A building.
Any signs of life would be nice.
Since when did we decide Nina was a building and not a small woman?
Sounds like a small woman to me.
It's not a small woman.
Small woman out in this desert would be hard to see.
How is he still high? Sure you got your measurements right?
Yes, they're right.
You're 100%, right? Yes.
Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong.
Are you really questioning Suzie? She's a genius, Jonathan.
Even geniuses make mistakes. Well, she didn't.
If that small woman is small enough, she could fit behind a small tree.
Stop! Just…
Ouch. What are you doing?
I am stopping us before we get more lost.
Give me the coordinates. Um, okay.
Longitude is 116 degrees, five minutes, and 17
Slow down. Slow down.
Nina!
Nina.
Nina?
Nina!
Holy macaroni.
All right. You just go straight down. Like, straight… straight…
Right on the money, as I said.
It just doesn't make sense. Yo, dudes!
My dudes!
Jesus Christ.
Come check this shit out!
What is it?
Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes!
Come on! Hurry!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!
Okay.
So no small woman named Nina.
But you said any signs of life, am I right?
Right.
Well,
these are no regular tire tracks, brochachos.
I mean, look at the tread on these monsters.
They're fatties. And you know what that means.
Military.
We gotta go.
Well, I wouldn't do it if I didn't think she was ready.
But either way, I don't think we have any other choice.
Do you? No, I don't.
Yeah.
It might take me some time though. Just… As fast as you can.
It's gonna take us two hours to get to Nellis as it is.
And, Ellen, one more favor.
Can you send somebody over to a Max Mayfield's house?
There are some kids there that just need looking after, okay?
Ellen? Hello?
Sam? Hello?
Why the long face, Doc?
We just wanna talk.
No! Wait!
No! No!
What…
You can't leave, Eleven.
Where is Dr. Owens?
Dr. Owens had a change of heart.
I know you wish to go to him,
and there's nothing I can do to stop you
from forcing open that door.
But if my men hear you coming,
they will kill him.
And alone, you will never find your way out of this desert to your friends.
Here's what we're going to do.
You and I are going to complete our work together.
And when I decide that you are ready,
we will return to Hawkins, together.
Papa and daughter.
Why are you doing this?
Because there's no other choice.
There is a choice.
Only one that is right.
And you make the right choices?
I try.
Did you make the right choice with Mama?
Fourfifty.
Your mother was sick, Eleven.
She was a danger to herself and to others.
She brought a gun into the hospital. She killed a man.
Hospital?
No.
A prison.
Everything I have done was for your own good.
For your own protection.
And Henry?
You kept Henry in that lab.
With the children.
Was that for our good?
Was that a right choice?
I had no idea what Henry would do.
I cared for you.
I loved you. I loved all of you.
Even Henry?
Yes.
I was trying to help Henry, to understand him. Yes.
Yes, I cared for him.
Even after what… what he did?
Yes.
Because I knew I had failed him.
So this morning,
you said you believed he was always alive in the darkness.
Is that why I was searching the darkness?
Was I looking for him? For Henry?
No. No.
We were focused on the Soviets.
You knew that.
"""Papa does not tell the truth."""
Henry said that.
And now you trust Henry?
Henry, who's manipulated you like some puppet?
You are the one who released him from his prison.
You.
And now you are angry with yourself
and you're taking your anger out on me
and you're risking everything.
No.
No, you.
You have risked everything!
You have lied!
You made me look for him!
The gate.
The Mind Flayer.
So many dead.
And all because of you.
Because you could not stop.
You could not let him go.
I came here to try and understand who I was.
To see if I…
if I was the monster.
Papa!
And now I know the truth.
It is not me.
It is you.
You
are the monster.
I am going to open that door,
and I am going to leave
with Dr. Owens.
If you try to stop me, I will kill you.
You'll soon see the truth, Eleven.
Ah!
Is this legal?
Actually, I think it's a felony.
Right.
But it guarantees one thing.
I won't miss.
How's she feeling? Light. But durable.
Deadly.
But reliable.
Hear me now.
There will be no more retreating…
…from Eddie the Banished.
Hey, you're really ready for battle.
You get it?
"""Battle."""
BAT.
No?
I thought I had a good one.
What are you doing?
You son of a bitch!
No wedgies! No wedgies!
Never change,
Dustin Henderson.
Promise me?
I wasn't planning on it.
Good.
Good. Good.
Hey, Sinclairs.
How are those, uh… those spears coming on?
Flip that damn thumb around.
What?
It's too loose, Lucas.
This isn't a basketball game
where they blow the whistle when your shoes fall off.
Okay, okay, for the record,
my shoes never fell off.
Okay, for the record,
it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off when you're riding the bench.
Yet, for some reason,
you show up to every game.
Mmm, except the one that mattered.
Plus, Mom and Dad forced me.
Bull. Mom and Dad can't force you to do shit.
Well, even though you're a benchriding loser,
you're still my brother.
Just the facts.
It just doesn't make sense. What doesn't make sense?
That was Dan Shelter. He graduated, like, two years ago.
So? So he's in college.
Which means he was visiting on spring break.
Fast Times was returned, like, I don't know, a week ago?
Right? Unless she's got some horndog brother we don't know about.
Which is possible.
Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold?
Steve. Nah.
What? I don't care.
I don't understand why you do either with everything that's going on.
Honestly, this feels like a perfect time for that little pull of the rug because…
in the face of the world ending, the stakes of my love life
feel spectacularly low.
Yeah. I mean, I get you there,
but… I still have hope.
Not everything has a happy ending. Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know.
I'm not talking about failed romance.
I just…
I have this terrible,
gnawing feeling that…
it might not work out for us this time.
You think we shouldn't be doing this?
I think we're mad fools, the lot of us, but…
…but if we don't stop him, who will?
We have to try, right?
Yeah.
To killing Vecna.
Slash Henry.
Slash One.
It's only a precaution, Eleven.
I never intend to activate it.
I very much hope
our fighting has come to an end.
Shh.
Shh.
I know.
You're angry with me.
But it was the only way.
The best way.
What's going on? It's Sullivan.
They found us.
Go, go, go!
Three! Two! One!
Go to the back! Get moving!
Move out! Go!
Get 'em out of here! No more time!
Evacuate now!
Move!
Steady! Fire!
Eleven, we have to go.
What is happening? They've come to kill you.
Evacuate immediately. Please proceed…
Clear. Clear!
Quarter and search by twos. Hicks, take the upper level.
Yes, sir.
Sir?
We found something you're gonna wanna see.
Well, well.
And what happened here?
Hmm?
Are Mommy and Daddy fighting?
Okay.
Let's try this again, shall we?
Where's the girl?
Where do you think you're going, Doc?
Why don't you give 'em some lead? I got it.
Down he goes.
VictorTwoSierra, this is CharlieLimaGolf.
Do you copy, over?
VictorTwoSierra, I copy, over.
We've got the target in our sights.
Requesting permission to take the shot, over.
Jack, you don't have to do this.
It's over, Sam.
Wait! Wait! Wait! I can put her in a coma.
A medically induced coma.
We have the drugs. We can do it right here.
And we'll see if… if these murders keep happening.
If you're right, the killing ends, and you can pull the plug on her.
In fact, I'll do it myself.
But if you're wrong about this,
God, are we gonna need her.
Jack.
Don't do this.
I'm begging you.
Take it.
You son of a bitch!
No! You son of a bitch!
Green light. Light her up.
Civvies. Five o'clock.
The hell?
There she is! There she is! Where?
On the ground! What are those dudes doing on the ground?
Is that blood, man? Shit.
VictorTwoSierra, we've got a civvy headed our way.
Ignore it. Just take out the girl.
Copy that. Ignore the civvy. Take the shot.
Found ya.
Hell are you doing? Hold her steady! I don't know, man. Something's wrong!
Jesus Christ.
Holy shit!
Shit!
I'm losing her!
Shit!
Shit! Shit! I can't! I can't hold it!
Shit! Shit! Shit!

It's me.
I'm here. Okay.
Everyone's here.
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Oh shit.
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Shit!
Eleven.
You… Are you okay?
I'm okay. Okay.
Hey, guys. We gotta go.
We gotta get you outta here.

Eleven.
I want you to know
I'm proud of you.
So very proud.

Goodbye, Papa.

But we need to get you somewhere safe. Gonna be people behind us.
No, Mike, we need to get to Hawkins tonight.
We'll never make it. That's over 2,000 miles.
We need to find a way.
If we don't, they are going to die.

Damn it! Remember, they're listening!
Okay. I wanna run through it one more time.
Phase one. We meet Erica at the playground.
She'll signal Max and Lucas when we're ready.
Phase two. Max baits Vecna.
He'll go after her, which'll put him in his trance.
Phase three? Me and Eddie draw the bats away.
Four.
We head into Vecna's newly batfree lair, and…
…flambé.
Nobody moves on to the next phase until we've all copied.
Nobody deviates from the plan, no matter what.
Got it?
Got it.
Be careful. Thanks, buddy.
Here goes nothing.
What does he want us to do, applaud?
All right.
Let's go.
Gotcha.
Hey, guys, listen.
If things here start to go south, I mean, at all,
you abort.
Okay? Draw the attention of the bats.
Keep 'em busy for a minute or two. We'll take care of Vecna.

Okay? You guys are just Decoys.
Don't worry. You can be the hero, Steve.
Absolutely. I mean,
look at us.
We are not heroes.
Hey, Steve?
Make him pay.
No, no. Like I said, I… I've tried everyone.
Yeah, TWA, Pan Am, Eastern.
No, it doesn't have to be a oneway.

No. No. No.

We'd suffocate.

They don't suffocate.
Jesus Christ. Holy shit.
I have a way.
A way to protect Max.
From here.
This is Max.
When One attacks, he'll be in her mind.
But I can do that too.
I went into Mama's mind, into Billy's.
I can go into Max's.
She can carry me to Vecna.
I can piggyback.
I can protect her.
From One.
Fight him from here.
Mind fight. Righteous.
Wait, so you actually think this can work?
A bathtub would help.
Yeah. Gotta be clean to enter the mind.
What? No, no. It's a sensory deprivation tank.
It helps her calm down and focus on her powers.
Wait, we… we just passed a motel.
Yeah, but they won't have enough salt.
Well, how much salt are we talking here, my dudes?
Well, depends on the size of the tub, but a lot.
Does 600 pounds suffice?
You know a place that has 600 pounds of salt?
Let's see…
Yep.
Mmhmm.
Yep. It'll work.
What will work?

Okay, and, uh, who exactly was this mystery woman?
Not sure.
I mean, she wasn't exactly Miss Talkative.
You know? I spent five minutes trying to convince her I was real.
I'm supposed to be dead, remember?
Anyway, I finally get around to halfconvincing her,
she starts to open up a little, then says that she's…
A friend of the doc's.
Great, so am I. Now put me on the phone with him.
I'm afraid the doc is indisposed.
"""Indisposed""?"
It gets worse.
She said the doc's with the girl.
And the girl went off to fight some evil in Hawkins.
Then they all went offgrid. The doc, the girl, everybody.
"""The girl,"" meaning… El."
Yeah, it has to be.
This is your daughter, American?
Mmhmm.
And they're not alone.
Joyce's kids are with 'em.
Okay, I… I see the mood here is bleak.
And understandably so.
But I do think we need to consider
the very real possibility
that this mystery woman is, in fact, KGB.
And she's No.
She's telling the truth.
When we were in the lab, those particles we saw,
they were alive.
And if they're alive, that means a gate's open in Hawkins.
"""Gate""? What does this mean?"
It means we have to go home right now.
What is taking so long?
I thought you said he was close.
Yeah, close to sabotaging us, you mean.
We think he's playing us again.
So put a goddamn gun to his head.
And then what? He just spits out more lies.
It's moot anyway.
If your kids are truly in some kind of imminent danger,
even if we were to leave this very moment, we wouldn't make it in time.
The earliest we'd get there is late tomorrow.
No, we… we don't have to make it back.
Not tonight.
Whatever this evil is,
we know it's connected to the hive mind.
And now we know part of that hive mind is in Russia.
So we don't need to get back to Hawkins to fight it.
All we need is to destroy those particles.
And if we're lucky,
it'll hurt it enough to give the kids the upper hand.
Wait, time out.
We're talking about the particles inside the prison?
The prison that we just narrowly escaped from?
We broke out.
We can break back in.
Jim!
The entire Soviet army is looking for us.
Sure. And we'll be exactly where they least expect.
All right. There is a fine line between courage and stupidity,
and this falls very far on the side of stupid.
This is Dirty Dozen stuff.
Except there are, uh, four of us.
Three, actually.
Breaking back in's gonna be easier than breaking out.
Which is why we need an airlift. This is where you come in.
I don't care what it takes.

That's all right, my dude.
We're not here for your tasty pies.

She needs a tub with a bunch of salt so we can enhance her psychic power
so she can save the world from this super bad dude.

I actually crawled backwards.
Crawled backwards?
You know, I'd push with my hands like this. Beep. Beep.
Always in reverse, you know?
Come on, it makes sense. You push to move, right?
No, no, it doesn't make sense.
Well, it did to my tiny little Harrington brain.
That is, until I reversed my baby butt down a flight of stairs
and thumped my head really good.
Yeah.
Wow. That explains
so much.
Yeah.
I think it kinda does.
I think, like, right out of the gate, like, I'm super confident.
But I'm also, like, an idiot.
Which is just… I mean, it's a brutal combination.
But, I mean, the good news is,
I get a big enough thump on my head, I can change, you know?
I can learn.
I can
crawl forward.
Listen, I guess what I'm trying to say in a really stupid, roundabout way is, um…
…is thank you.
Thank me?
Yeah. For…?
For giving my head the biggest thump of its life
two years ago.
I needed it.
It's changed my life.
And now I'm crawling forward.
Slowly.
I just wonder sometimes…
you know, if… some other girl had given me a proper thump before we'd met,
would things have been different?
Like, if we were meeting together for the first time right now, part of me…
I dunno, part of me thinks we would've made it.
Steve…
Remember the dream I told you about?
About the Winnebago?
Seeing the country with my six lil' nuggets?
It's all true.
Every last word.
But I left one part out.
It's the most important part.
You're there.
You've always been there.
Hey, guys!
You guys! Awesome news!
Looks like we weren't going the wrong way after all.
Come on.
Let's go! Okay.
Ro… Slow down! Ro… Robin!
Erica.
Where are the guards?
Maybe this'll be easier than we thought.
I don't know, Jim. I got a bad feeling about this.
I have a question.
What if I don't want to answer?
Have you always been a coward?
Yuri Ismaylov
is many things, you traitor.
But he is…
no coward.
If that is so,
why do you continue to stall?
What do I owe these Americans?
Nothing!
This isn't just about America, smuggler.
They have warned us of a great evil in the world.
An evil that does not rest,
that does not respect borders.
After it has consumed everything in their land,
it will come for us.
For our families.
For our Motherland.
You saw it with your own eyes.
You know it to be true.
And yet you continue to play tricks!
I was told the Peanut Butter Smuggler
was once a great man.
Before he lost his way to drink and cards.
That he led his men to victory over the Chinese in Damansky.
Is it true?
It is true.
That hero, where is he now?
Because I do not see him.

Yeah.

You know,
the last few days, I… I've had to think about the last talk we had.
You know, before the cops and…
the whole world went to shit?
I… I guess
I just…
I dunno.
I guess I just wanted to say that
Surf's up, Romeo.
Oh, uh, too much flavor awesomeness can't overpower your battery, can it?
Dude, this is pineapple. Try before you deny.

Okay! Okay!
No, you're right. It's good.
Do you remember that time you told me you had a Lego stuck up your nose?
What? Yeah.
Like, it was like a… It was like a construction guy.
You'd call him Larry. Come on! You don't remember?
He had the high viz jacket and removable hat?
Yeah.
Vaguely.
Well, I remember it like it was yesterday.
Man, I was… I was freaked.
'Cause… 'Cause this Larry… I mean, Larry was way, way up there.
I don't even know how you got him that far up.
I had to do surgery. I… I had to get tweezers to pull him out.
Bull. No.
No, no, I swear on my life.
I don't know, I just…
I feel like you used to come to me more for help.
Or to just… talk, you know?
'Cause, like, you don't do that anymore.
Not like before.
A lot of that is probably my fault.
This last year…
…I know I've been distant.
Or stoned.
Or stoned.
Yeah.
But that has nothing to do with you.
And that's me dealing with my own shit.
Hiding from my own problems.
The truth is,
I miss talking to you.
I, like, really miss it.
And I think,
right now,
we need to talk more than ever.
Because things are getting just complicated.
A lot more complicated than Legos up the nose, you know?
I just…
I don't want you to forget that I'm here.
And I'll always be here.
No matter what.
Because you're my brother.
And I love you.
And there is nothing in this world, okay,
absolutely nothing,
that will ever change that.
You got that?
Yeah.
And I'm always
here for you too.
I know.
I know you are.
Come here.
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah? Yeah.
I think it's ready.
All right.
It's time.

They're carrying a light.
A blue light.
What are you waiting for, asshole?
Hmm? I'm right here.
I'm right here!
Okay, El, what's going on?
It's not working.
What? What's not working?
Max's plan.
I know you can hear me.
I know you can read my thoughts.
Even the worst ones.
Maybe mostly the worst ones.
I thought about what you said.
About how I wanted my brother to die.
I thought you were just trying to upset me.
To anger me.
But you weren't, were you?
You were just telling the truth.
Billy, he made my life living hell.
Every chance he got.
So, sometimes…
when I would lie in bed at night, I would…
I would pray…
…I would pray that something would happen to him.
Something awful.
I knew that he drove too fast, so I would imagine him
crashing.
Dying in that stupid car.
I just…
I wanted him out of my life.
Forever.
I wanted him to disappear.
The day that he died…
I think that's why I just stood there.
Watched.
Not because I was scared or… weak.
But because…
I didn't know if he deserved to be saved.
And I've tried to forgive myself.
I've tried, but…
I can't.
I can't.
So now…
now, when I lie in bed at night…
I pray that something will happen to me.
That something terrible will happen to me.
So that's why I'm here.
Because…
I just want you to take me away.
And I want you…
to make me disappear.
Is that all true?
You wanted Billy to die.
Why are you talking?
You ever have thoughts like that about me?
What?
No, Lucas, never.
Normal people don't fantasize about killing other people, Max.
You realize that, right?
Lucas, please.
I thought you were getting better.
But you're not, are you?
You are sick.
Lucas, you don't mean that.
Maybe it is good he takes you.
Maybe it's for the best.
In fact…
…I'm glad it's going to be you.
You will be the chosen one.
The fourth. The final sacrifice.
It's going to be you that breaks the world.
Max? Can you hear me?
Max!
Max!
He has her.
Max.
Where are you going? Don't be scared. Stay away from me.
Max, I thought you said you were ready.
Ready to disappear!
I said, stay away!
Max. It's okay.
I'm coming.
I'm coming. Just hold on a little longer.
I dunno if you can hear this. I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry, Billy.

What?
Uh
Stay back.
If you touch her again,
I will kill you again.
Is that what you did?
Hmm?
Did you kill me?
I am so glad
you are here, Eleven.

So beautiful.
And it's all thanks to you.

Before
I kill you…
…I want you to watch.
Papa is dead.
I know what he did to you.
You were different.
Like me.
And he hurt you.
He made you…
into this.
He is the monster, Henry.
Not you.
Not you.
You're right.
You
and I,
we are different.
And Papa did hurt me.
But he was no monster.
He was just a man.
An ordinary, mediocre man.
That is why he sought greatness in others.
In you.
And me.
Hmm.
But in the end…
he could not control us.
He could not shape us.
He could not change us.
Do you not see, Eleven?
He did not make me into this.
You did.
At first,
I believed you had sent me to my death.
To purgatory.
But I was wrong.
I was somewhere new.
I became an explorer.
An explorer of a realm
unspoiled by mankind.
I saw so many things.
And one day,
I found the most extraordinary thing of all.
Something
that would change everything.
I saw a means to realize my potential.
To transcend my human form.
To become the predator
I was always born to be.
It was…
It was you.
Always you.
All I needed was someone to open the door.
And you did that for me.
Without even realizing it.
Didn't you?
And when you did realize,
you chose to resist.
So I sought a means to open my own doors.
I sought…
your power.
All this time, we've been building it.
For you.
So, don't you see?
Once again,
you have freed me.
No.
You don't have to do this.
You can still stop this.
It is over, Eleven.
Your friends
have lost.
No!
Eddie!
There is nothing…
nothing you can do
to stop this now.
Hawkins will burn and fall.
And the rest of this senseless, broken world.
And I will be there.
Lucas!
I will be there to pick up the pieces when it does.
Lucas!
And remake it into something… beautiful.
There was a time
when I had hoped to have you by my side.
But now I just want you to watch.
Don't be afraid.
Try and stay very still.
No.
It will all be over soon.
Max!
El! El, can you hear me?
El, come on. Wake up! Wake up, El!
Wake up! El! She can't breathe.

I want you to know I'm here, okay?
I'm right here.
And…
I love you.
El, do you hear me?
I love you.
I'm sorry I don't say it more.
I… It's not because I'm scared of you.
I'm not.
I've never felt that way.
Never.
But I am scared that one day
you'll realize you don't need me anymore.
And I thought if I said how I felt, it would somehow make that day
hurt more.
But the truth is, El, I don't know how to live without you.
I feel like my life started that day we found you in the woods.
You were wearing that yellow Benny's Burgers Tshirt.
And it was so big, it almost swallowed you whole.
And I knew right then and there, in that moment, that I loved you.
And I've loved you every day since.
I love you on your good days.
I love you on your bad days.
I love you with your powers, without your powers.
I love you for exactly who you are.
You're my superhero.
And…
I can't lose you.
Okay? Do you hear me? I can't lose you.
You can do anything.
You can fly. You can move mountains.
I believe that.
I really do.
But right now,
you just have to fight.
Okay?
El.
Do you hear me?
You need to fight!
You have to fight.
Fight!
Fight!
That's it, El.
Fight, El.
Fight.
Fight!
Eddie!
Max!
Fight!

Hey, assholes!

I don't believe in a higher power
or divine intervention.
But that was a miracle.

Don't you?
But this
is only the beginning.

You have already lost.
No.

in an event that seismologists are calling
"""a natural disaster of nearunprecedented scale."""
The death toll now stands at 22.
But with hundreds more filling Roane County hospitals
and many more still missing,
officials expect those numbers to rise.
Go! This way! This way! Let's go!
This is only the latest tragedy to befall this oncesafe town.
Most recently, a string of high school students were killed
in a series of ritualistic murders,
which have been linked to a local satanic cult
"known as ""Hellfire."""
Eddie Munson, the leader of this cult and prime suspect in the murders,
has been missing since the earthquake and is presumed dead.
But this offers little comfort to the people of Hawkins,
who are scared, angry, and searching for answers.
Why their town? What have they done to deserve so much suffering?
A growing chorus believes the two recent tragedies are linked,
claiming the Munson murders opened a doorway between worlds.
A doorway, they say, into hell itself.
Are you hearing this?
They're now calling it a doorway into hell.
Great. More hysteria. Just what we need.
Well, it's the news.
Now indistinguishable from the tabloids.
Hey, Nance!
I found some more of your old stuff in the attic.
Mr. Rabbit.
It's okay if you wanna save him, you know?
No, he'll be more loved in a new home.
Someone order a pizza? Pizza?
Mom!
Hey!
You are never going on vacation again, you hear me?
In fact, you can forget about college.
You are staying right here.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay.
But, Jonathan
This isn't an earthquake.
I know.
I know a lot more than you think.
How?
We've been trying to call you I know.
I know. I'm sorry.
We just couldn't risk contact.
"""We couldn't risk contact""?"
Hey, hey, I'll tell you everything, okay?
Okay. I promise.
But, for now,
I'm just glad you're safe.
Where's Lucas?
He's at the hospital.
Was he hurt?
No. No, he's…
Oh God.
You don't know.
"""He opened his eyes, and further words died in his throat."""
"""He forgot about the need to sick up that horrible parody of wine."""
"""He forgot about his mother,"
and Uncle Morgan, and his father,
"and almost everything else."""
"""Speedy was gone."""
"""The graceful arcs of the roller coaster against the sky were gone."""
"""He could feel the hair stirring on the nape of his neck,"
"could feel a goofedup grin pulling at the corners of his mouth."""
"""Speedy! I'm here, my God!"""
"""I'm here in the territories!"""
Oh my God.
We've been calling you guys like crazy. I know.
We came as soon as we heard.
I'm sorry.
Do they know…
when she will wake?
No.
They say she might not.
Her heart stopped.
For over a minute.
She died.
I… I mean, clinically, but…
then she came back.
The doctors don't know how.
They say it's a miracle.
I'm here, Max.
Hi. Hi.
Uh, so these are blankets and sheets.
And some… some clothes and… and some kids' toys.
Wow. It's already so organized.
We appreciate that.
Do you want a tax receipt for it? Um…
No. I don't think that we need one. Thank you, though.
But is there anything else that we can do to help?
Okay, then we sort by age.
We've got infants, girls, boys, men, women…
Oh, if anything is in too bad shape, we really don't want that.
I found another jar of peanut butter, and it's crunchy…
Robin.
Hi.
What are you doing here? I am…
I… I am making PB&Js.
Right, yeah. No. Duh. Of course.
Uh, I… I am also making PB&Js, as it so happens.
Cool.
Hey, uh, I… I'm sorry if that came out weird.
"I didn't mean it like, ""What are you doing here?"""
"I just meant, ""What are you doing here?"" Like, ""Nice surprise. Great to see you."""
Uh…
I didn't take it as anything negative. Okay, good. Good.
No, I… I'm sorry. My brain's been a little frazzled lately.
'Cause Of everything?
Yeah.
Yeah, and Dan.
Um, he's my boyfriend.
Well, was my boyfriend.
He was visiting, took one look at this,
and it's not what he was envisioning for spring break.
"He was like, ""I'm outta here. Back to Purdue. Good luck."""
Which, ultimately, it's bordering on a good thing, 'cause he was grating on me.
He is the type who trashes Fast Times 'cause it has no plot.
I should've just ended things right there and then.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I am rambling about my dumb boyfriend when there are people out there suffering.
Who need… food.
And I have just made a peanut butter on peanut butter monstrosity.
Um…
I don't know what's wrong with me.
Um, it's like sometimes my mouth is moving faster than my brain,
and it's like this runaway train,
and I cannot seem to get it to stop, no matter how hard I try.
You know what I mean?
Uh, yeah, I think I know what you mean.
It's a gift.
Oh, for me? You're welcome. Mmhmm.
You really shouldn't have. Oh, but I did.
I just don't even deserve it. But I did.
I mean, thank you. Early birthday.
Thank you so much. Oh, oh, wow.
H2O?
Vital for all forms of life.
Mr. Munson?
I'm Dustin Henderson.
Can we talk?
I can't imagine we got anything to talk about.
My nephew is innocent.
He's still missing.
I'll put up as many posters as I need until he's found.
Good day to you.
I was with him.
I was with him when the earthquake hit.
And… where is Eddie now?
I'm…
I'm so sorry.
I wish everyone had gotten to know him.
Really know him.
Because they would've loved him,
Mr. Munson.
They would've loved him.
Even in the end…
he never stopped being Eddie.
Despite everything.
I never even saw him get mad.
He could've run.
He could've saved himself.
But he fought.
He fought and died to protect this town.
This town that… hated him.
He isn't just innocent…
Mr. Munson, he's…
he's a hero.
Oh Jesus.
Holy shit.
This place is a total disaster.
Yeah.
Well, that's a bit of a problem.
I get we gotta hide Supergirl,
but this isn't exactly the Fortress of Solitude, man.
It's more like a fortress of grodiness.
Come on, guys, seriously.
I've seen Mike's room look worse than this.
Ah, brutal, dude.
Ah! See?
Water still works.
And, voilà. Cleaning supplies.
All right. That's good.
Hold it right there.
What's he doing?
Looks like he's gathering mushrooms.
He's a little on the eccentric side.
Welcome to the club, right?
Yeah, welcome to the club.
Hey, Nancy?
Yeah?
I'm sorry I wasn't here.
Oh. I mean…
to be honest, I'm kinda glad you weren't.
I just mean, I'm glad you were with Mike.
And Will.
And I'm… I'm glad you were here too.
Otherwise, who'd have been in charge?
Steve?
He's actually grown up quite a bit, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Hey.
Yeah?
Are we okay?
Yeah.
Yeah? Yeah, totally.
Yeah, it's… it's just…
You know, it's hard.
I feel like
life keeps throwing things in the way of our big plans.
Yeah, sure seems like that.
"You think it's too late to throw ""saving the world"" on your college resume?"
Your… Your application letter…
Not that it matters at all anymore, but…
did it ever come?
No. No, uh…
Not yet.
Did she… talk to you at all?
Not much.
I mean, a little bit.
Dr. Brenner.
He says that she wasn't ready.
And now she's starting to think he was right.
That's crap.
If it wasn't for her, if she hadn't left the lab,
Max wouldn't be alive right now. I know.
It's just, she's, um…
She's never lost before.
Not like this.
She'll have another chance. Let's hope not.
Let's hope One is dead and rotting.
He's not.
Now that I'm here, in Hawkins,
I can feel him.
And he's hurt.
He's hurting.
But he's still alive.
It's strange, knowing now who it was this whole time, but…
I can still remember what he thinks,
and how he thinks.
And he's not going to stop.
Ever.
Not until he's taken everything.
And everyone.
We have to kill him.
And we will.
We will.
Government.
Max?
Max?
Max!
Max!
Max!
Hey, kid.
Hi.
I kept it open.
I kept the door open three inches. I know.
I never stopped believing.
Oh, I know. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay. I'm here.
I'm here.
You look…
Not fat?
And your hair.
My hair?
Look at your hair.
Yeah.
I kinda stole your look, kid.
Yeah.
Well, what do you think?
Bitchin'. Hmm.
You aren't the only one that didn't stop believing.
Oh!
I'm happy
you went to your…
conference.
That was quite the experience.
Oh.
Hey.
You've grown.
Yeah.
You shrunk.
Mom, it's snowing!
