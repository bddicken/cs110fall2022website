</h1>
<br/>

Welcome to the Fall 2022 UofA cs110 course homepage.
This is the first in a sequence of two introductory programming courses in the computer science department at the University of Arizona.
This course requires no prior programming experience, but does require that you have taken College Algebra.
We will be using python 3 in this course, and as a student, you will learn the basics of this language.
By the end of the semester, you should be able to write complete, well-structured programs in python.
For more information about the course and policies, see the [course syllabus](./syllabus/index.html).
