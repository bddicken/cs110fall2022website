# Prep Problem - 1

In this problem, you should write a function named `longest_word`.
This function should have one parameter, a string with words separated by spaces.
If there is a tie, it should return the earliest word in the string.
The function should `return` the longest word from the parameter string.
A few examples:

* The call `longest_word("one fish two fish")` should return `"fish"`.
* The call `longest_word("deoxyribonucleic acid is crazy")` should return `"deoxyribonucleic"`.

Name the program `prep26.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
